Since 1721 it has seen 74 prime ministers of highly varied competence and backgrounds but few if any as incapable of steering the country through perilous times as the current incumbent, Theresa May, who could end up being compared to George III because of the consequences of her ineptitude.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	578

In British history there is a classic instance of this: In 1945 Winston Churchill was rudely and unexpectedly removed from office in a general election and replaced by the leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	1390

It turned out that Attlee (who was deputy prime minister during the war) was precisely what the nation needed, not only to get through years of austerity imposed by the near bankruptcy created by the war effort, but as the parliamentary leader with the skills to re engineer British society and provide its people with a comprehensive safety net including, notably, free universal health care for life.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	1765

She ran a government department that was so large and so challenging to master that some prime ministers were known to have deliberately given it to rivals in order to destroy their careers: the Home Office, a Whitehall edifice that could perhaps be compared to a nightmare package embracing the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Homeland Security.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	4633

It needed a team that combined a complete command of administrative detail, a shrewd sense of the national interest, an equally shrewd assessment of the opposing interests, and an ability to understand the difference between bottom line economic interests and the EU’s loftier moral values as an alliance committed to protecting constitutional democracy in a continent with an unhappy history of autocracies.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	6955

The closest she has ever come to articulating the case for the Brexit deal she negotiated that set up a 21 month transition period for achieving a new free trade agreement with the EU (the deal that she is again stuck with trying to amend and resuscitate despite that fact that the EU has warned it will not renegotiate) was to say, repetitively, “It is in the national interest for everyone to get behind it.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	7875

All along she had been trying to reconcile elements that are not reconcilable: keeping the support of her party’s lunatic fringe that is undismayed by the prospect of a “no deal” exit that would bring extreme self harm while also holding the loyalty of the center of the party and doing this while satisfying the terms the EU is prepared to allow.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article820791520.txt	8852

May did receive a boost on Thursday from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said in a press conference alongside May that Japan supported her withdrawal agreement and that the “whole world” wanted to avoid a situation where the U.K. left the bloc with no trade deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article815412286.txt	2641

‘There needs to be a reckoning’ for those who spread Russia collusion narrative: Mollie Hemingway	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	0
Those who spent the last two years pushing the narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election need to be held accountable, the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued Friday.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	99
Earlier in the day, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in its report on the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice and it was announced that no new indictments would be forthcoming.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	329
During Friday's All Star panel segment on Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier," Hemingway along with Washington Free Beacon editor in chief Matthew Continetti and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason weighed in on the breaking news that reverberated throughout Washington.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	539
MUELLER SUBMITS LONG AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	832
Hemingway began by noting that the “Russia narrative” predates the Mueller probe, having begun circulating during the 2016 election after the creation of the infamous Clinton campaign funded Steele dossier, which pushed the theory that then Republican candidate Donald Trump was a “Russian agent.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	903
“We have, for the last three years ... frequently [witnessed] hysteria about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election,” Hemingway told the panel.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	1201
“The fact [is] that there are no more indictments coming and the fact [is] that all of the indictments that we’ve seen thus far have been for process crimes or things unrelated to what we were told by so many people in the media was ‘treasonous collusion’ to steal the 2016 election.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	1366
“If there is nothing there that matches what we’ve heard from the media for many years, there needs to be a reckoning and the people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government who were not critical and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable,” she added.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	1651

Mason told the panel that there’s likely “some relief” in the White House, particularly from Jared Kushner, the president's son in law and top adviser.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	2176
And while he insisted it was “too early” to draw major conclusions, he later added that those who attacked Mueller’s credibility throughout his investigation will have to walk back their hostility if he concludes that there was no collusion, including President Trump.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	2328
Meanwhile, Continetti suggested that the Mueller report could be the “greatest anticlimax in American history,” and that the entire investigation could be “for nothing” because it was “an investigation without a crime.” He did, however, insist that the “battle will continue” as the White House will fight Congress on transparency of the Mueller findings.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832984694.txt	2597

Britain will beg the European Union for a delay to its EU withdrawal to give a desperate Theresa May more time to find a way out her Brexit mess.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	88
In a series of votes Thursday, members of parliament [MPs] voted to instruct May to go back to the EU to request a new Brexit deadline.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	234
The British government wants to extend the current deadline for three months if May’s hated Brexit deal is approved by March 29.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	370
If she can’t get that through parliament, there could be a much longer delay.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	499
Britain can’t decide to extend the Brexit deadline by itself, however.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	577
That will require the approval of each member state of the EU which is by no means guaranteed unless May can give them good reason to allow her more time for to work on a deal many consider to be dead.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	648
If British lawmakers don’t approve May’s deal by March 29, and an extension isn’t approved by the EU, then the country is still set to crash out of the bloc without a deal in 15 days.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	850
Earlier in the day, the government revealed it intended to hold a third vote on May’s deal some time next week.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	1034
If it completes a trilogy of defeats, MPs will then get to vote on a range of options to indicate exactly how they want to proceed without May’s deal and without leaving with no deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	1146
However, changing course would cause a much longer Brexit delay which the government warned could cause “real damage to the public's faith” in politics.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	1330
A British government minister told The Daily Beast that the prime minister will now begin what amounts to a bribery campaign in which she’ll throw money at members of parliament for their pet projects to win their backing for her deal by the end of the new propsed deadline.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	1483
“I suspect the big HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] chequebook is about to be dusted off and promissory notes to fall like confetti,” said the minister	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	1758
The government also hopes the threat of a much longer delay will force the hand of the anti EU MPs who voted against her deal believing it would keep the U.K. too closely entwined with Europe and bring them into line in a potentially decisive third vote to make sure Brexit happens.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	1908
A spokesman for the European Commission reiterated that a deadline extension would require the “unanimous agreement” of all its member states, and each leader will have to “consider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	2191
A separate vote Thursday saw lawmakers overwhelmingly reject the idea of a second referendum on independence.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	2545
Although it wasn’t a legally binding vote and doesn’t completely rule out the prospect of another referendum, the number of lawmakers who voted against it indicate it is unlikely to win a majority at any time in the near future.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	2655
MPs also rejected the chance to wrestle the Brexit process away from the prime minister by turning down a measure which would have given them control of parliamentary time next week to arrange a series of votes on alternative brexit options.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	2884
That measure rejected by just two votes would have allowed MPs to find a way forward on Brexit without May’s deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	3126
That means MPs have this week voted against May’s deal, against leaving the EU with no deal, against holding a second referendum, and against using their power to find an alternative route to get Britain out of the Brexit stalemate it finds itself in.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	3241
The decision to delay Brexit came after a week of humiliation for the prime minister a feeling she must be used to by now.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	3493
Lawmakers rejected her deal for a second time on Tuesday night in a defeat which was only marginally better than in January when it suffered the worst defeat in parliamentary history.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	3616
Then, on Wednesday, lawmakers voted against the U.K. ever leaving the EU without a deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	3800
Although that vote wasn’t legally binding, it was another crushing government defeat which some of her own ministers decided to abstain on.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	3889
May’s misery wasn’t helped by Donald Trump on Thursday when he said he was “surprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations” and criticized the prime minister because she didn't listen to his advice on Brexit, commenting: “It could have been negotiated in a different manner.” May revealed in July last year that Trump told her, in typical Trump fashion, the best way forward would be to sue the EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	4029
Asked if he thinks the Brexit deadline should be extended, Trump said: “I think they are probably going to have to do something, because right now they are in the midst of a very short period of time, at the end of the month and they are not going to be able to do that.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	4454
However, the president warned against a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership, saying it would be “unfair to people who have won.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830821478.txt	4726
Do critics of Mueller owe him an apology now?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	0
So, if Mueller in effect clears Trump, I expect to see a lot of folks who insisted Mueller was a dirty cop, deep state, witch hunter to suddenly discover Mueller’s integrity.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	47

I don't think so.	0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	322

They also hope for the Report to indicate some dirt on Trump for which he cannot be indicted while in office, but which he may have to face after he leaves the presidency.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	487
And as for conservative critics of Mueller, I will speak for myself.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	659
First of all, he should never have hired Andrew Weissmann to be his lead investigator, who, it has been suggested by many, was the actual boss of the investigation, as Mueller withdrew from active, day to day management.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	728
Weissmann had disgraced himself in the prosecution of Arthur Anderson's work for Enron, where the guilty verdicts were thrown out by the Supreme Court, after that firm had been utterly destroyed, costing thousands of people their jobs and the partners their fortunes.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	949
Second, the prosecutors included no Republican donors but many Hillary donors, and the team initially included Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose fanatic hatred for Trump, disdain for his supporters, and determination to act as an "insurance policy" in case he was elected, should have disqualified them.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	1217

Third, once it became clear that the Steele dossier the very basis for the appointment of Mueller was a Hillary generated oppo research fantasy, Mueller should have announced that he would not pursue what the law calls the "fruit of a poisonous tree," resigned, and disbanded his investigation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	1612
Fourth, so far as we know, though I would be delighted to learn otherwise when the Report is released, Mueller pursued no investigation of Democrats and Hillary for colluding with Russia.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	1911
We know that after laundering their money through the law firm of Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, a foreign intelligence agent named Christopher Steele was employed by the Hillary campaign and DNC to collude with Russian intelligence sources and influence our election.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	2099
So far as we know, Mueller was not told to investigate only Republicans.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	2366
Fifth, the aggressive prosecutors ruined many innocent lives with the costs of lawyers, including the destruction of professional careers.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	2439
We now know that an abusive threat to prosecute him was made against author Jerome Corsi unless he signed a "confession" he claims was untrue.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	2578
Special counsel Robert Mueller's team offered Corsi a proposed plea agreement, which would have required him to admit to one criminal charge with two components: lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	2721
Corsi refused to sign the plea deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833018464.txt	2981

Prime Minister Theresa May was facing a significant and potentially catastrophic defeat on a major Brexit vote in Parliament Tuesday, a defeat that could eventually lead to anything from no Brexit at all to a general election as May's allies took a page from “Game of Thrones” and ominously warned: “Winter is Coming.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article816460196.txt	95

May has been criticized by both sides of the debate for her handling of the implementation of the 2016 referendum, with Remain supporters accusing her of presiding over chaos, with pro Brexit factions in her own Conservative Party claiming that she has kowtowed to Brussels and that her deal does not actually lead to Brexit being delivered.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article816460196.txt	889

In February 1993, federal agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives raided a Branch Davidian religious compound near Waco, Texas, after the agency heard reports that the Christian cult, under the leadership of David Koresh, had stockpiled illegal firearms and explosives.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832920387.txt	2167

On Sept. 9, 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno named former Sen.

What is the Irish border backstop and why do Tory MPs hate it?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1014
The so called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the PM's Brexit deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1077
This is what it means: What is the backstop?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1177
The backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK EU trade deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1222

This means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK and there can be no new trade deals.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1621
It also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1716
Why have Ireland and the EU demanded it?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1786
Because Britain demanded to leave the EU customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees people and goods circulating inside met EU rules.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1827
This is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains current rules, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU UK trade deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	1984
But the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between transition and final deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2134
Why do critics hate it?	0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2245
Because Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2269
Getting out even if there is a trade deal can only happen if both sides agree people and goods can freely cross the border.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2327
Brexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2455

What concessions did Britain get in negotiating it?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2703
During the negotiations, Britain persuaded Brussels the backstop should apply to the whole UK and not just Northern Ireland.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2755
Importantly, this prevents a customs border down the Irish Sea even if some goods still need to be checked.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2880
The Government said this means Britain gets many of the benefits of EU membership after transition without all of the commitments meaning Brussels will be eager to end the backstop.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	2990
It also got promises the EU will act in 'good faith' during the future trade talks and use its 'best endeavours' to finalise a deal promises it says can be enforced in court.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	3174
What did the legal advice say about it?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	3351
Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said even with the EU promises, if a trade deal cannot be reached the backstop could last forever.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	3391
This would leave Britain stuck in a Brexit limbo, living under EU rules it had no say in writing and no way to unilaterally end it.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	3520
The DUP on whom the Tories rely for a Commons majority, insisted their objections to Irish border backstop arrangements remained, while the EU closed ranks in the face of demands for new concessions.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	3652
After a meeting with the Prime Minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: 'The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government's commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.'	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	3852
Mr Dodds again attacked the proposed Irish border backstop, which would see the UK remain under EU customs rules if no wider trade deal was agreed by the end of a withdrawal transition period, as unnecessary.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	4070
However, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would not accept any changes to the deal that would make the backstop inoperable.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	4279
Mr Varadkar said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to 'stand by' the Brexit deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	4407
He said: 'We're happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.'	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	4556
Mr Varadkar said the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes, focused on securing the ratification of the deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	4723
The remarks are a blow to the Prime Minister, who is trying to get concessions on the Irish backstop plans in the hope it will convince MPs to vote her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament later this month.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	4839
Mr Varadkar's comments came as the EU confirmed 'no further meetings are foreseen' with the UK on updating Mrs May's Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813949697.txt	5049

Earl Rasmussen: Obviously there are certain elements, mostly in the mainstream media that's been stoking this, and certain members on the Hill, in Congress, that were hoping for something, because we heard over and over again that the next bombshell was coming.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833050243.txt	640
But you're correct, there's nothing explosive, and with no new indictments coming out, and really if you look at the indictments that were there, there's nothing related at all to any type of conspiracy or collusion as far as the six people indicted who are US citizens.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833050243.txt	902

One of these is a trial by the Department of Transport to examine using the former Manston airport in Kent as a lorry park in case of congestion around the Port of Dover, one of the main points of cross Channel traffic with Europe.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814251296.txt	544
Up to 150 large trucks will be parked and released from the airfield at 0800 and 1100 Monday morning to test the utility of the site to relieve pressure on Kentish roads including the M20, which can become extremely busy when there are delays at the ferry port.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814251296.txt	776
An email from the Department for Transport send to Cliffsend Parish Council reported by Kent Online said of the test: “The use of Manston airfield as an HGV holding facility is one of the traffic management measures as part of the current draft plan to alleviate congestion on Kent roads in the event of any disruption at the border.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814251296.txt	1038

Ireland and the Border	0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	24
Ireland has been a trouble spot since the invasion of the island by the English king Henry II in 1171, whether to prevent a rival, Strongbow, from controlling the area, or to overcome the damaging opprobrium resulting from the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on December 29, 1170, by four of his knights.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	47
Declaring that Ireland was a part of his empire, Henry II changed the course of Irish history as resident Normans in the area pledged their loyalty to the British crown.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	371
Almost a thousand years later, the borders of Ireland remain a difficult political problem, and indeed may have dominated the debate over the last few years over the issue of Brexit.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	541
Economic and political relationship between the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland, part of the UK, has been a central factor in the negotiation process of the UK and EU over Brexit.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	724
Thus, the border issue is not simply bilateral, it is also an EU issue.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	919
The problem is compounded by the fact that the Brexit issue evokes historical memories as well as having political as well as economic implications.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	991

The crucial problem arose with Henry VIII and his decision to leave the Catholic Church and have the country adopt Protestantism, to which many Irish were opposed in their desire to remain Protestant as well as speak their own language, Gaelic.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	1238
Oliver Cromwell invaded Ireland to reestablish control over Ireland, massacring over 2,000 of the population in the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649, while Ulster, a Protestant bastion, remained loyal to England, as it still is.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	1483

However, the struggle for Irish emancipation starting in the 19thcentury continued.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	2190
After the failed Easter Rising against British rule in April 1916, guerrilla war between the IRA and Britain occurred, 1919 1921.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	2274
It ended in May 1921 with the partitioning of the country, ending British rule in most of Ireland.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	2404
The Irish Free State was created as a self governing Dominion in December 1922 while Northern Ireland, NI, remained in the UK.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	2503
Finally, on April 18, 1949 the Republic of Ireland was established, an independent republic, headed by a president.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	2630
However, hostilities between the IRA and the government continued in Ulster, virtually 30 years of civil war, including the Bloody Sunday incident on January 30, 1972 when 28 unarmed civilians were killed by British troops during a protest March in Derry (Londonderry).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	2746
Hostilities lasted until April 10, 1998, Good Friday, which began the peace process.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3016
Good Friday was concerned with creating an infrastructure of cooperation between north and south, between the Irish government and the newly created power sharing Irish Assembly, in Northern Ireland.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3101
It also implied the normalization of relations between Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, and between Britain and the ROI.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3301
The normalization would mean the opening of the border which had previously been manned by British soldiers.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3446
As a result, since both countries are still in the EU, there are no checks on goods or people moving between Northern Ireland and the ROI.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3555
The open border is the most tangible symbol of the peace process as well as of economic cross border cooperation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3694
All political sides in the Brexit negotiations agree there should not be a “hard” border, checks on persons, goods, or infrastructure, dividing NI from the ROI whatever the outcome of final negotiations.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	3808
Therefore, keeping the border open and abiding by the Good Friday Agreement is critical.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4012
As a result, Brexit negotiators devised the so called “backstop,” a political invention, a fallback position, to keep the border open as much as possible between the ROI and NI, even if no comprehensive trade deal can be reached between UK and EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4101
NI is the only part of the UK that has a land border with another EU country, the ROI.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4349
By backstop, the whole of UK, according to Prime Minister Theresa May, would enter in a single customs territory with EU, no tariffs on trade in goods between UK and EU, though NI would be aligned to other rules of the single market.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4436
Two problems are related to this.	0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4670
One is that May does not favor a permanent customs deal lest it prevent British free trade deals with other countries.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4704
The other is that her proposals have twice been defeated in the House of Commons, on January 15, 2019 by 432 202, and on February 14, 2019 by 303 258.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4823
In the latter vote, her own Conservative party, 5 voted against her, and 67 others abstained.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	4974
The essential features of the EU, single market and customs union, allow people, goods, and services to enter other EU countries without inspection.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5068
The basic problem is that if Britain leaves the EU it will probably lead to delays and checks in this policy.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5217
The reality would be that the ROI and NI would be in different customs and regulatory regimes, and British goods would be checked at the border.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5327
The backstop, a last resort, is intended to prevent full border controls on goods crossing between ROI and NI.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5472
For Britain one problem is that it can only end the backstop arrangement with EU agreement.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5583
The issue is both economic and political.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5675
The fear is that barriers between North and South Ireland might revive the old animosity, the Troubles, the 30 year conflict over NI status as part of the UK.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5717
Military controls of the 500 kilometer border were only removed with the Good Friday agreement which provided for more collaboration and free movement between the two entities.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	5876

The dilemma of Brexit negotiations continues, especially since PM May does not have full support from her Conservative party.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	7129

A major problem is that the scheduled departure of UK from the EU on March 29 may have to be delayed because of the difficulties in agreeing on future trade and economic relations.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824256050.txt	7361

But parliamentary opposition to her deal remains fierce, with the main sticking point being the safety net "backstop" measure which would guarantee no hard border is erected on the island of Ireland in the event that post Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the bloc prove unsuccessful.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814427361.txt	1467
Critics of the backstop, which proposes that the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, remain in a customs union with the EU "unless and until" the bloc agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border, argue it could tie the UK into the EU's orbit indefinitely.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814427361.txt	1765

"There are some MPs who are looking for an excuse to back the deal and so, something tokenistic and declaratory from the EU on the backstop clause would work for them, but I don't understand how that would work for the DUP, and that's where the action is," he added.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814427361.txt	3666

The dinner capped another whirlwind day for Trump.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832940138.txt	2471
As they braced for the report throughout the day Friday, Trump and his team tried to convey an image of a president putting his head down and focusing on the job.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832940138.txt	2522
Aides arranged a meeting with the leaders of five Caribbean countries, the president announced his pick to join the Federal Reserve and he bragged about the defeat of the Islamic State.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832940138.txt	2685
But Trump quickly overshadowed those efforts, issuing a confusing tweet that implied he was undoing North Korea sanctions that his administration had just put in place.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832940138.txt	2871

But there were more subtle signs that the White House like all of Washington had assumed crash position ahead of the transmittal of Mueller’s report to Attorney General Bill Barr, which happened at 5pm, shortly after a sudden blinding hailstorm tore through an already anxious capital: White House counsel Pat Cipollone joined the president at Mar a Lago, according to a person familiar with the matter, as did Sanders, who doesn’t always travel with the president on weekend trips.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832940138.txt	4678

Though the president is often eager to field reporters’ questions, he ignored journalists as he sat alongside the Caribbean leaders, under two gold and crystal chandeliers.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832940138.txt	5463

Conservative voters want their MPs to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, a major survey reveals today.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	67
In a rare glimmer of hope for the Prime Minister, the poll finds that Tory voters back her deal by 46 per cent to 38.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	167
While a majority of voters across all parties (53 per cent) said Mrs May had failed to get a good deal – they also believed any alternative leader would have fared 'just as badly' in negotiations with the EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	285

But an accompanying survey of Conservative Party members paints a far gloomier picture, with activists opposed to the deal negotiated by their own leader by 59 per cent to 38.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	578
The research, co ordinated by Professor Tim Bale of London's Queen Mary University, also reveals that Tory members are convinced a no deal Brexit would be better than Mrs May's plan.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	754

The hardline stance of most Tory members will dismay Mrs May's allies, who had hoped that activists would use the Christmas break to pressure their rebellious MPs to fall into line.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	1868

Downing Street will also be encouraged by a finding that 40 per cent of members said their second preference was to leave with Mrs May's deal, suggesting they could live with the compromise.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	2168
And the study found that if Mrs May's deal was pitted directly against the option of Remain in a second referendum, Tory members would grudgingly back her plan by 57 per cent to 18.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953435.txt	2359

It's unclear how much of the report the public will be able to see and Barr said in his Friday letter that he would consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what information can be released to the public and Congress consistent with the law, the Special Counsel regulations and the DOJ's practices and policies.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833032366.txt	450

Goddard has defended his characterisation of Ms Soubry, saying the Tory MP had “shown [herself] willing to fight in favour of vested corporate interests, against the will of the people, and she is now trying to shut down legitimate free speech because it is inconvenient for her… those showing fascist, totalitarian, globalist tendencies should and will be compared to their greatest 20th century counterparts: the National Socialist Party of Germany.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article815858385.txt	1376

May’s withdrawal agreement has found opposition from Brexiteers resulting in the prime minister postponing the House of Commons vote before Christmas in face of certain defeat mainly over the issue of the Irish backstop which could see Northern Ireland locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc after the transition period, should London and Brussels not strike a deal, in order to stop a so called ‘hard border’ with EU member state Republic of Ireland.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814403783.txt	1661

Mueller Is Done, but the Trump Investigations Are Just Heating Up	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	0
The Russia investigation is over.	0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	67
Or is it?	0 0 0	article832956618.txt	101
Attorney General William Barr has notified Congress that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has “concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters,” as required under Justice Department regulations.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	111
Mueller has submitted to Barr a confidential report of “prosecution or declination decisions he has reached,” and Barr has promised to review the report and advise Congress of Mueller’s “principal conclusions” as soon as this weekend.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	349
Barr further stated that he would determine whether other information can be released to Congress and the public, committing to “as much transparency as possible.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	584
So what comes next?	0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	748
It appears that Mueller and a small staff will close up shop in the near future.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	768
But that does not mean that the investigation into President Donald Trump is over.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	849
Depending on the contents of Mueller’s report, Congress may have some work to do.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	932
Mueller’s original mandate required him to comply with all policies of the Justice Department.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1014
It seems likely, then, that he would adhere to the DOJ opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1109
If so, then even if Mueller found evidence of conspiracy between Trump and Russia to defraud the United States by interfering with the fair administration of elections (sometimes referred to as “collusion”), he would refrain from filing an indictment, and instead provide his findings to members of Congress for them to consider whether impeachment is appropriate.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1217
If that is the case, then Congress’s work will just be beginning.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1582
Other prosecutors may also have more work to do.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1648
During the course of his investigation, Mueller has kept a narrow focus on his own mission and farmed out related cases to at least four U.S. Attorney’s Offices.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1697
Those investigations remain ongoing.	0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1859
It is possible that Mueller has handed off additional investigations in which charges have not yet been filed, and so would be unknown to the public.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	1896
For example, the investigation of fraud and campaign finance violations against former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was handed off to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	2046
Cohen pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to three years in prison, but it appears that work on that case continues.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	2246
Earlier this week, a judge approved the release of redacted search warrants in the Cohen case, permitting prosecutors to keep more than 18 pages of text from public disclosure.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	2373
The redacted pages appeared under the heading “Illegal Campaign Contribution Scheme.” The court stated that redaction was necessary because “disclosure would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.” This language suggests that the work of SDNY is far from over.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	2550
Subjects of the investigation could include Donald Trump, Jr., who reportedly signed at least one of the checks that were provided to Cohen as reimbursement for his illegal payments to silence woman from publicly accusing Trump of extramarital affairs .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	2809
Reports have indicated that Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, has received immunity in exchange for his cooperation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	3063

In addition to SDNY, other U.S. Attorney’s Offices are also known to be working on matters that arose from Mueller’s work.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	3285

In that case, Flynn’s former business partner Bijan Kian and Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim were charged with agreeing to lobby U.S. officials and influence public opinion against Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, an outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832956618.txt	3605

Now people like Theresa May, who never supported Brexit, are using this negotiating period to hand to the EU everything it wants in the Withdrawal Agreement to blackmail the British people to accept an even worse arrangement than had they not voted to leave in the first place.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	1536
This point cannot be understated.	0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	1814

The withdrawal agreement was crafted by Germany and not negotiated by Jean Claude Juncker and Michael Barnier to punish the U.K. for standing up to the inevitability of the EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	1933
It is a message and a warning to Italy, Hungary and Poland.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	2110

And no one is more to blame for this mess than the members of Parliament who continue to virtue signal about the horrors of a no deal which the British people have become less and less scared of every day.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	2354

And if the members of parliament who continue to go through the pantomime of an existential crisis would leave it aside and simply say that’s it, no deal it is, that would end the uncertainty and the worry that is now the dominant narrative in the press.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	2677

All because of Brexit, they argue.	0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	2988
No, all because of MP’s who refuse to embrace the situation as it stands and face the reality that sovereignty is more important than a quarter or two of tightened belts and some annoying paperwork.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	3023
Moreover, the biggest fear now is the one which is that Britain ends up better off if they not only threw off the shackles of the EU but also its own corrupt and, frankly, traitorous leadership.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	3222

And that is simply blackmail.	0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	4086
What is obvious watching British parliamentarians at this late stage is that a majority of them are unwilling to face reality that the EU is not in their best interest.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	4116

Mr. Juncker made it clear there is nothing better forthcoming.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359423.txt	4745

It is hard to overestimate what a political disaster Brexit has been ever since the referendum passed on June 23, 2016.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	393
Britain, and to some extent the EU, have been almost completely deadlocked for two years.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	513
Now the committed date when Britain will leave the European Union is March 29, 2019.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	603
The problem has always been the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and (Southern) Ireland (which will remain part of the EU).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	688
Ireland and Northern Ireland have an extremely violent history described as “The Troubles,” which were resolved by the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which, among other things, committed to remove any physical border between the two and allow free movement of goods and people.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	837
It has been apparent since the beginning that no solution exists to meeting the objectives of the “Brexiteers” (the people who wanted Brexit) and maintaining a barrier free border.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1114
So that problem has always been insoluble and remains so today.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1295
So there are four possibilities for what will happen on March 29:	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1359
“Crashing out of the EU” – a no deal Brexit.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1425
Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan.	0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1470
Killing the whole Brexit thing.	0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1505
Kicking the can down the road by extending the March 29 date.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1537
There is no U.K. majority for any of these options, but if there is no agreement, then the default will be a no deal Brexit.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1599
In my opinion, a way will be found to avoid this because it will be catastrophic for the economies of both the U.K. and E.U.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1724
I had thought that the Brexit decision was final once Britain submitted its two year notice on March 29, 2017.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1849
However, in the last few months, an E.U.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	1960
court has issued an opinion that Britain can reverse the Brexit decision, provided that it does so with finality and not just to start up a new two year negotiation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2001
So that is an option.	0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2167
However, if Britain’s government invokes it, it will invoke the howls of hell from people who say that the government is violating the will of the people.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2189
Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which I summarized in detail in October, is a transition plan that many consider to be the worst of all possible worlds.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2344
The whole point of why the Brexiteers wanted Brexit was to get away from the E.U.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2500
regulations, E.U.	0 0	article813714967.txt	2582
taxes, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2600
In the transition period, all of these will remain, with the additional restriction that the U.K. will have to obey all the regulations and pay all the money, but will have no say in changing them.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2648
This plan is almost Karmic retribution for the idiocy of going ahead with Brexit in the first place.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2846
However, few people like Theresa May’s plan and many pundits say that when it comes to a vote in Parliament on January 14, it is unlikely to pass.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	2947
That brings us to the last option: kicking the can down the road.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3094
It is believed that if the U.K. requested it, then the E.U.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3160
would agree to extend the March 29 date.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3220
That would give time for more debate.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3261
Some people want to use that time to hold a new Brexit referendum.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3299
The problem with that option is that even among the few people who want a new referendum, there is no agreement on what the question would be.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3366
Would it be the same two choices as the 2016 referendum?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3509
Or would it be the three choices, something like the first three options in the list above?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3566
So really, no one knows what is going to happen out of this mess, but my bet would be that they will find some way to “fudge,” or to kick the can down the road.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3658

A big increase in the number of migrants illegally crossing the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, is being blamed on the chaos surrounding Brexit.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	3993
There are reports that human traffickers are telling migrants that crossing from France to Britain will be much more difficult after March 29 because of Brexit and charging the migrants €15,000 or more to cross the Channel in a cheap dinghy.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4162
At the same time, security has been toughened around ports and the Channel tunnel and authorities have been cracking down on migrants in northern France.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4404
However, there are still many more migrants who cross to Britain by stowing away on trucks that travel through the tunnel.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4558
This is actually a fairly small number of migrants, but it has become a major political issue in Britain.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4681
It is far smaller than the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Greece, where the E.U.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4787
border force has been patrolling the waters.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4886
But political pressure has forced Britain’s Home Secretary to reassign to British patrol cutters from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	4931
Many of the migrants are from Iran.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5075
This is believed to be the result of a policy that Serbia implemented between August and October 2017, offering visa free travel to people from Iran for 30 days.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5111
More than 40,000 Iranians visited Serbia, but it is believed as many as 12,000 did not return home after 30 days, but instead moved through the Schengen Zone to western Europe and, in particular, to Calais, France, hoping to reach Britain.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5273
The trip across the English Channel is 21 miles, but cross currents can make the trip much longer.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5513
The trip can be particularly dangerous due to high seas and busy shipping lanes.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5612
If a British patrol boat captures the migrants in British waters, then they are required to take them to Britain; otherwise, the patrol boat can return them to France.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5693
When a migrant reaches Britain, he is evaluated for eligibility for asylum.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5861
Iranians are likely to be granted asylum because of Iran’s human rights record.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	5937
For that reason, migrants from Iraq or Syria often claim to be from Iran.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813714967.txt	6017

Schiff on end of Mueller probe: 'We have to find the truth'	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	0
Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said about a month ago the "evidence" of Trump collusion with Russia was "in plain sight.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	61
"Chairman Burr must have a different word for it," Schiff told host Dana Bash on "State of the Union," pointing to communications between Russia and Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump aides George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	214
"You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence," Schiff said, adding, "There is a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt."	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	442
If there's "evidence in plain sight" for Russian collusion, then Mueller is either blind or in cahoots with Trump, because the special counsel isn't indicting anyone else.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	690
But Schiff is nothing if not tenacious.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	862
He is vowing to continue the investigation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	902
"We will find the truth," he told Wolf Blitzer of CNN.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	946
Today, Schiff and numerous other politicians, pundits, and various left wing loons are still digging through that manure pile looking for the pony they are certain is there.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article833028146.txt	1001

Friday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D HI) seemed to push aside special counsel Robert Mueller report pointing to “other entities” investigating the Trump Organizations.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832934428.txt	88

The fuss about Brexit over in the U.K. is of only indirect interest to us Americans, but it does show another aspect of the slow political revolution taking place all over the Western world.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	48
As our own correspondent Robert Henderson posted here at VDARE.com on Thursday, the Brexit vote of June 2016 the vote by British people to leave the European Union was of a piece with the election of Donald Trump five months later.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	239

On the evidence of this week, I'd have to say Britain's is ahead.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	920
British Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated a deal with the EU, a package of conditions under which Britain could finally leave the EU on March 29th.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	986
It was a lousy deal for the Brits, keeping the nation chained to the EU bureaucracy in a hundred ways.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	1142

Tuesday this week Britain's parliament finally got to vote on Mrs May's deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	1386
They voted it down.	0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	1464
That generated a mini crisis as the opposition party in parliament called a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	1484
That vote, however, went Mrs May's way, so she remains in power.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	1605

Here's a sound clip from last week.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2329
It's from a weekly show on BBC TV called Question Time, in which a panel of pundits and politicians takes questions from a studio audience.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2365
This being the BBC the panels are slanted left liberal, making it usually a pretty dull show.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2505
This Thursday's Question Time panel, however, included political journalist Isabel Oakeshott.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2599
Following those earlier events of the week, the question of course came up: Is there now any alternative to a "hard Brexit"?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2693
Ms Oakeshott took the question.	0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2818
Here's what she said:	0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2850
Oakeshott: Well, the answer … look, I can save everybody a lot of time here …	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2872

Because it's been two years, so, so, …	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	2966
Oakeshott: The short answer is: No, there isn't.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3006
And that is why it seems to me the only option for Theresa May now and I'm going to admit that it is a sub optimal position is to walk away.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3055
That is all she can do.	0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3196
Emcee: So to leave with no deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3221
Oakeshott: Yes, absolutely, because that isn't … (Drowned out by prolonged cheering and applause from the studio audience.)]	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3255

I can't forbear adding that Question Time is a peripatetic show, set in a different city each week.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3693

It's worth adding also that the Brits seem still to have some of their resourcefulness in the face of impending chaos.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	3879

The firms fear that chaos over the absence of customs rules at ports of entry following a hard Brexit will slow down or stop entry of goods.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	4167
That's private action, not government action; but I'm reminded of Margaret Thatcher and the crisis with Britain's coal miners in the early 1980s.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817449755.txt	4308

Britain’s Attorney General Deals Blow to May’s Rejigged Brexit Deal	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830153674.txt	0
Britain’s attorney general has dealt a potentially fatal blow to Theresa May’s rejigged Brexit deal as lawmakers prepare to vote on it later today.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830153674.txt	69
The prime minister returned from Europe late Monday night with what she claimed were “legally binding” changes to the deal that was overwhelmingly rejected last month.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830153674.txt	217
She claims the changes mean the Irish backstop the controversial measure designed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland could not “become permanent” as anti EU lawmakers had feared.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830153674.txt	385
Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has published legal advice that shoots down some of her claims.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830153674.txt	589
He writes that if Britain wanted to remove itself from the backstop, it “would have… no internationally lawful means of exiting the [the backstop] arrangements, save by agreement [with the EU].” Support for the rejigged deal likely hinged on Cox’s confirmation that something substantial had changed.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830153674.txt	683

One of the dangers of the Brexit debate is that everybody is making hidden assumptions about what others will do.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	220
One of these assumptions is that the EU would only be too happy to extend the Brexit deadline.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	334
The EU would, of course, extend to give time for ratification of a deal or even to make way for a cross party deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	429
But Theresa May would have to make clear pretty quickly that this is what she wants to do after the meaningful vote goes against her for a second time – which may well happen.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	545
However, the idea that the EU is willing to accept a long extension, or a semi permanent one, is fanciful for a number of reasons.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	721
The most important relates to power politics within the EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	852
The EPP has to be mindful of the impact a long delay would have on the balance of power, especially if it were to expel Viktor Orban.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	912
If the UK were forced to hold European elections in May it would not send a single delegate to the EPP, which means that the EPP’s relative position in the parliament would weaken further.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	1046
A long delay would almost certain lead to an outcry among Brexit supporters, and could trigger a groundswell of support for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	1235

Ship of Fools: How a S... Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.89 Buy New $7.30 (as of 09:15 EDT Details) If the meaningful vote is negative – as it may well be – we assume that May would at this point try to reach a cross party agreement to open up the discussion on the future relationship, by giving the House of Commons the right to pass instructions to the government for the post Brexit negotiations.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	1514

Tony Connelly writes in RTE that the two sides were working on three separate strands: one on the guarantee of the backstop’s temporary nature; a second on the technological solutions that might replace the backstop; and a third on how to change the political declaration.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	2060

Eurointelligence assumes a soft Brexit majority would almost certainly assert itself.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	2528

Howarth concludes “If the Government brings back the same deal without an exit to the backstop, it will be defeated.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	2943

The UK will leave.	0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3143
In short, don’t panic: if MPs hold their nerve, we are leaving the EU on 29th March without a permanent backstop.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3162

Crunching the Numbers – Guardian	0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3466
The Guardian did the math as it stands today [March 5 as reported by Eurointelligence] : May needs an additional 110 votes to get the deal through – from a pool of 115 Tory MPs and 40 Labour MPs in leave voting seats.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3499

This leaves a total of 148 MPs.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3812
If 10 20 Tory Brexiteers reject the deal, she will need to pick up some 20 30 or so Labour MPs to get it through.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3844
And it seems that the best way to get those Labour MPs lined up would be an open vote on the future relationship, including the option a customs union.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829267754.txt	3958

Some of the reasons given by the seven members of parliament [MPs] at their dramatic press conference were similar to the bitter arguments which have seen Conservative party politicians angrily fighting amongst themselves.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824684605.txt	615

Several MPs who’ve been severely critical of Corbyn since he became leader have issued statements saying that they still think trying to change the party from within is the best way forward, but that Corbyn has to see Monday’s resignations as the final warning.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article824684605.txt	2557

Government Sparking ‘Apocalyptic Fears’ over Clean Break from EU	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814630609.txt	0
Leading Brexit campaigners have said that the Government is sparking “apocalyptic fears” over the prospect of MPs voting against the prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement and the UK making a clean break from the EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814630609.txt	66
Writing in a paper published Monday entitled ’30 Truths About Leaving on WTO Terms’, Conservative peer Peter Lilley of Global Britain and Councillor Brendan Chilton of Labour Leave said that to break the House of Commons deadlock over the Irish backstop in Theresa May’s deal the United Kingdom should push for a Canada style free trade deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814630609.txt	282
However, if the EU is unwilling to renegotiate such terms, the Government should leave without a formal agreement “No Deal” and revert to the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which Britain is already a member.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814630609.txt	625
Lord Lilley and Cllr Chilton point out that leaving on “WTO+++” terms would mean not only saving £39 billion from the divorce bill envisaged in Mrs May’s deal, but also end the “corrosive economic and political uncertainty” of the two year transition period, resolve the Irish border issue “by administrative measures without need for a backstop – as all parties have promised in the event of ‘no deal'”, and continue to trade with the EU on zero tariff rates for up to a decade whilst negotiating a “Canada+++” trade agreement, as permitted under WTO Article 24.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814630609.txt	854

The Brexiteers debunked scare stories perpetuated by Remain politicians and establishment media by explaining that in the event of a WTO exit Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC )and the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs MRC (DEFRA) will not need to carry checks on all goods at the border, but only on goods if there is a perceived risk with HMRC saying it will “prioritise flow over compliance” to prevent long queues at ports.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814630609.txt	1565

To see how serious the political elite’s war on Brexit has become, consider this: Tony Blair has been having secret talks with French president Emmanuel Macron on how to prevent Brexit from becoming a reality.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830359136.txt	22

An unintended consequence of the Industrial Revolution that saw Britain (UK) go on to forge an empire which at its height covered a quarter of the globe, was the forging of a unified working class whose unity transcended national, cultural and regional differences.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article816720060.txt	2950

Speaking to the Press Association on New Year’s Eve, he said: “Well one of the things which upset many, many Londoners and many people across our country and in Europe is the tone and language used by politicians in Westminster, giving the impression we’re insular, inward looking, not welcoming to Europeans.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813602345.txt	1174

“Bearing in mind Parliament can’t resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government,” he said.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813602345.txt	1623

However, these wares might not be flying off the virtual shelf so quickly these days, as a handful of polls indicate that Britain’s main opposition party is suffering as a result of its ambivalent stance towards a second vote on leaving the European Union.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article822220578.txt	544

Despite Theresa May’s desperate 11th hour attempts to polish her Brexit deal into something acceptable to lawmakers after they rejected it with the most overwhelming government defeat in British parliamentary history in January, the rejigged deal was knocked back again this evening in another whopping, and humiliating defeat by 391 votes to 242.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	421

Lawmakers are talking about a number of scenarios: a third vote on May’s deal either before or after a deadline extension; the highly uncertain scenario of leaving with no deal; or taking it to the public with a second referendum, or even a general election.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	3088

There is also frustration among the more pragmatic MPs who feel the prime minister has done everything she can to compromise with the pro Brexit lawmakers, and their intransigence is now the only thing that could prevent Brexit entirely.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	3805
One possibility if all other options such as no deal or a deadline extension are ruled out is that the deal is voted on a third time and, faced with prospect no Brexit happening at all, it’s passed.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	4043

One of the few Conservative MPs who fell in behind May on Tuesday night after previously voting against the deal said he was partly motivated by the new concessions from Brussels but “more importantly if we don’t, there’s a good chance we won’t get any form of Brexit at all.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	4504
Penning, who helped run May’s leadership campaign, had previously described the prime minister’s deal as “dead as a dodo” but he told The Daily Beast he had changed his mind because he feared his parliamentary colleagues would vote later this week “to block hard Brexit, which means we’ve got no negotiating position; so we’re stuffed in this limbo forever and a day.”	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	4781
However, Penning rejected Walker’s suggestion of a general election.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	5150

In a bid to stave off an earlier defeat, May was forced to accept that if her deal was rejected for a second time, she would allow MPs to hold a vote the following day on whether they would accept a no deal Brexit.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	5623

According to legislation passed by the House and still on the books, Britain will automatically plunge out of the EU in 17 days even if there is no withdrawal agreement.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	5961
A large majority of MPs believe that would be extremely damaging to Britain as decades of trade deals, cross border agreements, regulations and rights would disappear in a puff of smoke.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	6131
It is therefore likely that the House of Commons will vote against no deal, that prospect increased when May reacted to her defeat by declaring that there would be a “free vote” that means the government effectively does not even have a policy on one of the most important votes in a generation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	6318
If Parliament does reject no deal Brexit, another vote would be automatically triggered for Thursday.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	6614
This time the question put to lawmakers will be: Should Britain request a delay to Brexit?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	6716
It is much harder to predict how that vote would play out as both of the main party leaders have effectively lost control of their MPs and would not be able to enforce the party whip.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	6807
Substantial numbers of politicians on both sides believe delaying Brexit would be an insult to the electorate who voted to quite the EU in 2016; while similarly large numbers believe no deal must be avoided at all costs.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	6991
There is also a smaller group of MPs who are plotting to hold a second referendum and would therefore vote for as long a delay to Brexit as possible.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	7212
For once May captured the mood of the House of Commons late Tuesday night when she said: “These are unenviable choices.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article830274102.txt	7362

Then there’s another thing that says; if we don’t get a free trade agreement by the end of the transition period, we’d enter a thing called the backstop that comes into play to safeguard the Irish border, which means that Britain and Northern Ireland become part of the single market and customs union.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813992175.txt	1291
We couldn’t get out of it; it goes on indefinitely and we’ve got no means of unilaterally exiting, we’d have to get the permission of the EU to come out, and if we want that permission, we’d have to get that permission from the twenty seven different countries, and each one of them could ask for trading concessions in order to get their permission, so it’s a dreadful deal.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813992175.txt	1594

British Prime Minister Theresa May said a vote on her Brexit deal will "definitely" happen next week, even as a new poll shows a majority of Britons would vote to remain in the European Union if there was a second referendum.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article814403875.txt	110

Chuck Grassley (R IA), Senate Finance Committee chairman, declared the Russian collusion narrative dead on Friday, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to Attorney General William Barr, with no further indictments planned.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	69
“Attempts to keep the collusion narrative alive, especially for political reasons, will only serve to further harm our political discourse and play into the hands of our foreign adversaries,” the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee said in a statement.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	320
He also noted that Mueller has been investigating any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin for “nearly two years now,” and the Justice Department even before the 2016 election.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	580
He also slammed the “millions” in taxpayer dollars and “aggressive surveillance tools” used, with still no evidence of collusion.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	766
“We know that the Russians tried to meddle in our democratic processes to sow divisions, as they have in so many other countries.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	896
But throughout this prolonged investigation, which cost tens of millions in taxpayer dollars and included aggressive surveillance tools, we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion,” he said.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	1026
Grassley joined fellow members of Congress in asking for Mueller’s findings to be released, to “finally put an end” to the “speculation and innuendo” that has plagued the administration since its inauguration.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	1222
“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	1432
Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832947600.txt	1533

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been under fire from the European Union for years for his opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open immigration policy.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	25
A policy which she herself has had to pull back on.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	198
And no matter how far Merkel has changed her stance and acceded to the reality of the damage her policy has created, Orban is still guilty of the sin of non compliance.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	250
Actually, he’s guilty of a whole lot more than that.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	419
Because Orban has not only stepped on the third rail of European politics he’s stomped up and down while taking a massive dump on it.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	472
That third rail, of course, is naming names.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	606
Naming the very person who controls so much of EU policy through his co opting large swaths of the European parliament.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	651
That person, of course, is George Soros.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	771
Now there is a push, ahead of May’s European Parliamentary elections, to kick Orban’s dominant Fidesz party out of the European People’s Party (EPP), a nominal center right coalition and the largest single party within the EU parliament.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	812

And with each victory over Soros Orban grows even bolder.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	1152
After a successful re election campaign predicated on the slogan, “Don’t Let Soros Win,” Orban has banned Soros’ major NGO, Open Society Foundation, as well as forced out his Central European University.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	1210
But his biggest sin was equating outgoing European Commission President Jean Claude “When things get tough you have to lie” Juncker with Soros’ attempts to weaken Hungary’s border.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	1414
His reward for this, and building a border fence which thwarts Soros and Merkel’s tactic of tying immigrants in the host country in legal limbo for years by being inset from Hungary’s actual border, has been an Article 7 procedure opened up against Hungary for not abiding by the EU’s position on human rights.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	1595
Poland is in similar hot water with Merkel but thanks to one of the few reasonable things within the EU’s framework, each country can use the other to veto the actual censuring and concomitant removal of voting rights within the Union that comes with the full application of Article 7.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	1906

It’s about how scared those people are of the rise in Euroskeptics like Orban across the continent ahead of May’s elections.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	2302

Recently, France’s Marine Le Pen, found out that the trial against her for tweeting out images of ISIS beheadings back in 2015, will go forward with the potential of landing her in jail for three years.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	2506
This is not much different than the kidnapping charge Sicilian prosecutors tried to bring against Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of Lega and all around bad boy Matteo Salvini in Italy.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	2709
This was a lame attempt to split Italy’s Euroskeptic coalition and keep it focused on internal trivialities versus mounting a real challenge in May’s elections.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	2901
The same is true now for Le Pen.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3062
Her National Rally party is polling within the margin of error of President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche with a real chance to send a plurality of French Euroskeptic MEPs to Brussels in a couple of months.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3095
Merkel is struggling with the same thing.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3300
And even though support for Alternative for Germany (AfD) has waned in recent polling, down to just 13%, don’t underestimate the voters’ desire to send a strong message to Brussels by voting in stronger numbers for the new or alternative parties rather than how they would vote for them at home.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3342
We’ve seen this in the past with UKIP who shocked everyone in the last European elections in 2014 with the size of the vote for them.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3638
It never translated into domestic momentum as typical prisoner’s dilemma concerns are more prevalent in Britain’s majoritarian voting system.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3772
But for the EU parliament where the two party system doesn’t hold sway and the direct benefits are harder to make a case to voters for, it’s much more likely voters will loosen up a little and throw their support for a smaller, less established party.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	3914
And that, along with some serious miscalculations about Brexit which I’ll get to in a minute, has the power elite in European political circles very scared.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	4166

Expelling Orban from the EPP will only give him more strength.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	4423
It will only give Euroskeptics more ammunition.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	4486
Orban, like Salvini, revels in being the outsider.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	4534

According to the latest polling, which you can find an up to date tally of here, Euroskeptic parties will take between 215 and 225 seats out of the 705 up for grabs, assuming Britain actually leaves and doesn’t stand for MEP elections, which at this point doesn’t look likely.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	4679

And if that agreement was structured so as to ease the way for the U.K. to rejoin the EU later are true, then there is no way Mrs. May will be able to forestall Brexit on WTO terms at this point, even if it takes another 90 days to do so.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article829815104.txt	5183

In 2016, after British voters unexpectedly rebelled against their political class and chose to leave the European Union, Donald J. Trump took to calling himself Mr. Brexit and guess what?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817147979.txt	162

Significant numbers of Leave MPs have embraced the idea, for two reasons: first, it simplifies matters because it is ready made system and allows business to plan; second is that it makes it harder for remainder politicians to sabotage Brexit after the UK has formally left the EU.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817147979.txt	4368

How did it come about?	0 0 0 0 0	article817147979.txt	5406
A German student leader of the 1960s Rudi Dutschke, echoing the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, put forward the idea whereby societies could be subverted from within by those of an internationalist bent who would patiently work to gain positions of power and influence.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817147979.txt	5429

The capture of Western societies by internationalists has allowed them to permit and even overtly encourage mass immigration of people from different cultures, denigrate their own societies, traduce the West and its native populations generally and introduce gradually the pernicious Totalitarian creed of Cultural Marxism which has “anti racism” (in reality anti white racism) at its heart.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817147979.txt	5960

Most MPs overtly or tacitly supported the idea of the referendum and its result by promising it in election manifestos, in Parliament and through their passage by large majorities of the legislation needed to both set up the referendum and make provision for its implementation.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article817147979.txt	6674

WASHINGTON: Special counsel Robert Mueller closed his long and contentious Russia investigation with no new charges Friday, ending the probe that has cast a dark shadow over Donald Trump’s presidency but launching a fresh wave of political battles over the still confidential findings.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	143
The report’s details remained a mystery, accessible to only a handful of Justice Department officials while Attorney General William Barr prepared to release the “principal findings” soon.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	429
But the closure of the 22 month probe without additional indictments by Mueller was welcome news to some in Trump’s orbit who had feared a final round of charges could ensnare more Trump associates, including members of the president’s family.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	618
The Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	862
Word of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats’ demands that it be quickly released to the public and Republicans’ contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	1037

With no details released at this point, it’s not known whether Mueller’s report answers the core questions of his investigation: Did Trump’s campaign collude with the Kremlin to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of the celebrity businessman?	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	1756

Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying “we look forward to the process taking its course.” But Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get “an early look” before they were made public.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article832948083.txt	5390

That’s not to question the bravery of individual officers, as exemplified by the British Transport Police who tackled the Islamist nutjob who stabbed three people, including a police sergeant, at Manchester’s Victoria station this week.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	2444

No doubt London’s two bob chancer of a Mayor Sadiq Khan would blame the absence of police on the streets on ‘austerity’ or the ‘Tory cuts’.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	2883
Maybe if he hadn’t splurged £2.3 million of taxpayers’ money on a vainglorious New Year fireworks display, he could have diverted more money to the Met to put extra bobbies on the beat.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	3023
Some of this largesse was frittered away turning the London Eye into a blue and yellow EU flag, as part of a cynical, self serving propaganda stunt aimed at bolstering the Stop Brexit campaign and burnishing the image of the Mayor himself.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	3209
I wonder if Tudor Simionov was aware of Khan’s New Year message boasting that London would remain open after Brexit, broadcast in a number of foreign languages, including Romanian.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	3449

The majority of Londoners may have backed Remain, but the really significant statistic is that more voted Leave (1.5 million) than voted for Khan (1.3 million).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	3752
What’s most likely to deter immigrants from coming here is not Khan slandering Leave voters as knuckle scraping, racist bigots, but the news that someone can be stabbed to death on one of London’s busiest, best known and most upmarket streets within two months of arriving in the country seeking a better future.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	3913

And if that chilling reality doesn’t put people off moving here from overseas, then perhaps they may be dissuaded by the paralysis on London’s roads and the exorbitant cost of housing two key problems Khan has exacerbated, rather than solved.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	4667

The streets are dirtier, rubbish piles up uncollected late at night, public transport is horribly overcrowded and traffic is gridlocked as a deliberate consequence of the Mayor’s policies.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	5105

Yet while innocent blood runs in the gutters, and police budgets are restrained, Khan indulges in fatuous propaganda stunts, whether floating a Donald Trump blimp over London or turning a traditional New Year’s party into a pro EU festival of political hubris.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	article813953273.txt	5373
