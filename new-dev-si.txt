Cruz 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
call 0
the 0
situation 0
a 0
tragedy 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
jury 0
of 0
her 0
peers 0
finds 0
she 0
did 0
something 0
wrong 0
then 0
Guyger 0
should 0
suffer 0
the 0
consequences. 0

To 0
be 0
clear, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
admitted 0
to 0
doing 0
something 0
wrong. 0

While 0
controversy 0
swarms 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
why 0
she 0
may 0
have 0
killed 0
Jean, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
kill 0
him. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

This 0
public 0
servant 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
innocent 1
man’s 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
dead. 0

Because 0
of 0
her 0
actions, 0
this 0
man 0
no 0
longer 0
lives. 0

That, 0
Senator 0
Ted 0
Cruz, 0
is 0
wrong. 0

Mistake 0
or 0
not, 0
she 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man. 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
to 0
blame 0
and 0
yet 0
she 0
is 0
still 0
collecting 0
a 0
paycheck 0
from 0
taxpayers. 0

Calling 0
for 0
Gugyer 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
calling 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
for 0
making 0
stupid 0
Instagram 0
posts 0
or 0
saying 0
stupid 0
things 0
she 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
she 0
should 0
be 0
fired 0
from 0
her 0
job 0
which 0
gave 0
her 0
the 0
gun 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

What 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
is 0
doing 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
their 0
apologists 0
are 0
doing. 0

They 0
are 0
treating 0
Guyger 0
differently 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
system. 0

In 0
Cruz’s 0
eyes, 0
Guyger 0
going 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
that 0
wasn’t 0
her’s 0
and 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
was 0
simply 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
being 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
place 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
time 0
a 0
tragic 0
mistake 0
that 0
ruined 0
two 0
lives, 0
according 0
to 0
Cruz. 0

But 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
case 0
at 0
all. 0

Would 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
and 0
police 0
officers 0
be 0
following 0
this 0
same 0
narrative 0
if 0
the 0
roles 0
were 0
reversed? 0

If 0
it 0
was 0
Botham 0
Jean, 0
a 1
black 1
man, 1
walking 0
into 0
the 0
apartment 0
of 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
a 0
white 1
female 1
cop, 1
and 0
killing 0
her 0
would 0
police 0
and 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
simply 0
write 0
it 0
off 0
as 0
a 0
tragic 0
accident? 0

Of 0
course, 0
we 0
know 0
the 0
answer 0
to 0
that 0
question 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
resounding, 0
NO. 0

To 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
peanut 0
gallery 0
before 0
it 0
begins, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
some 0
case 0
of 0
Democrat 0
versus 0
Republican 0
or 0
right 0
versus 0
left. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
right 0
versus 0
wrong, 0
and 0
what 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
did 0
to 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
was 0
wrong. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
way 0
around 0
it, 0
“mistake” 0
or 0
not. 0

From 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
this 0
case, 0
law 0
enforcement 0
have 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
protect 0
Guyger 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
blue 0
line. 0

Amber 0
Guyger’s 0
home 0
was 0
never 0
searched 0
while 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
was 0
searched 0
that 0
night. 0

The 0
results 0
of 0
the 0
blood 0
test 0
to 0
test 0
for 0
alcohol 0
or 0
drugs 0
in 0
her 0
system 0
were 0
never 0
released, 0
yet 0
police 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
his 0
mother 0
buried 0
her 0
son 0
claimed 0
they 0
found 0
marijuana 0
in 0
his 0
house. 0

It’s 0
been 0
a 0
smear 0
campaign 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
this 0
way 0
by 0
design. 0

Amber 0
Guyger 0
took 0
an 0
innocent 1
person’s 0
life, 0
and 0
because 0
people 0
are 0
so 0
blinded 0
by 0
the 0
badge, 0
she 0
is 0
being 0
portrayed 0
as 0
the 0
victim. 0

To 0
those 0
who 0
attempt 0
to 0
claim 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
bias 0
in 0
this 0
horrifically 1
flawed 0
system, 0
if 0
ever 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
case 0
to 0
prove 0
you 0
wrong 0
this 0
is 0
it. 0

A 0
tragedy 0
indeed. 0

The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
first 0
reported 0
on 0
the 0
story 0
prior 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
tweet. 0

Trump 0
and 0
Tillerson 0
have 0
had 0
a 0
fraught 0
relationship 0
for 0
many 0
months. 0

Trump 0
told 0
reporters 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
ultimately 0
decided 0
to 0
fire 0
the 0
secretary 0
because 0
they 0
disagreed 0
over 0
strategy 0
in 0
key 0
areas 0
of 0
foreign 0
policy, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
2015 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
the 0
approach 0
to 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
overall 0
tone 0
of 0
U.S. 0
diplomacy. 0

Tillerson 0
said 0
he 0
received 0
a 0
call 0
from 0
Trump 0
around 0
noon 0
Tuesday, 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
hours 0
after 0
his 0
firing 0
was 0
first 0
reported 0
by 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
announced 0
minutes 0
later 0
in 0
a 0
tweet 0
from 0
the 0
president. 0

His 1
voice 1
quivering, 1
Tillerson 0
thanked 0
career 0
diplomats 0
for 0
their 0
“honesty 0
and 0
integrity” 0
and 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
for 0
“acts 0
of 0
kindness,” 0
and 0
he 0
singled 0
out 0
Defense 0
Secretary 0
Jim 0
Mattis 0
for 0
their 0
partnership 0
and 0
mutual 0
support 0
of 0
diplomacy. 0

But 0
he 0
notably 0
did 0
not 0
thank 0
Trump 0
or 0
praise 0
his 0
policies. 0

Tillerson 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
remain 0
in 0
his 0
post 0
until 0
March 0
31 0
but 0
is 0
delegating 0
all 0
authorities 0
for 0
running 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
to 0
Deputy 0
Secretary 0
John 0
Sullivan 0
and 0
is 0
committed 0
to 0
ensuring 0
“an 0
orderly 0
and 0
smooth 0
transition.” 0
The 1
deposed 1
diplomat 1
also 0
made 0
a 0
clear 0
statement 0
about 0
Russian 0
aggression: 0
“Much 0
work 0
remains 0
to 0
respond 1
to 1
the 1
troubling 1
behavior 1
and 1
actions 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
Russian 1

CNBC 0
reports 0
that 0
Tillerson 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
firing 0
that 0
took 0

on 0
Tuesday: 0

On 0
Tuesday 0
morning, 0
State 0
Department 0
spokesman 0
Steve 0
Goldstein 0
said 0
Tillerson 0
had 0
no 0
plans 0
to 0

He 0
“did 0
not 0
speak 0
to 0
the 0

morning 0
and 0
is 0
unaware 0
of 0

for 0
his 0

the 0

added. 0

Two 0
White 0
House 0
officials 0
told 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
that 0
Tillerson 0
found 0
out 0
he 0

a 0

from 0

of 0

officials 0
at 0
the 0

told 0
the 0

Later, 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
fired 0
Goldstein, 0
who 0
contradicted 0
the 0
administration’s 0
account 0
of 0
Tillerson’s 0
ouster, 0
according 0
to 0
NBC 0

Goldstein 0
was 0
the 0
under 0
secretary 0
of 0
state 0
for 0
public 0
diplomacy 0

public 0

Trump 0
later 0
told 0
reporters 0
he 0
disagreed 0
with 0
Tillerson 0
on 0
some 0
issues 0
and 0
feels 0
the 0
diplomat 0
“will 1
be 1
much 1
happier 1
now.” 1

While 0
many 0
are 0
happy 0
that 0
Tillerson 0
is 0
gone, 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
are 0
concerned 0
with 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
being 0
installed 0
at 0
Secretary 0

regarding 0
his 1

who 0
exposed 0
the 0
criminal 0

of 0
the 0
Deep 0

Speaking 0
of 0

he 0
decided 0
to 0

in 0
on 0
the 0

did 0

anything 0
about 0

“The 0

jihadi 1
camps 1
have 1
existed 1
on 1

watchful, 1

those 1
who 1

the 1

statement 0
just 0
as 0
news 0
that 0

“Should 1

you’ll 1
like 1

Like 0
Clinton 0
and 0
her 0
Democrat 0

Pompeo 0
has 0
long 0
subscribed 0
to 0
the 0
belief 0
that 0
Russia 0
is 1
perpetually 1
meddling 1
in 0
U.S. 0

In 0

he 1
believes 1
Barack 1

got 1
Russian 1
help 1
too. 1

While 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
confirmed 0
as 0

the 0

lashed 1
out 1

” 1
itself 1

invading 1

doing 1
nearly 1

She’s 1
a 1
big 1
fan 1
of 1
torture, 1
according 0
to 0
a 0
2013 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article 0
pointed 0
out 0
this 0
morning 0
by 0
The 0
Intercept: 0

IN 0
MAY 0
2013, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
Greg 0
Miller 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
clandestine 0
service 0
was 0
being 0
shifted 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“a 0
management 0
shake 0
up” 0
by 0
then 0
Director 0
John 0
Brennan. 0

As 0
Miller 0
documented, 0
this 0
official 0
whom 0
the 0
paper 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
because 0
she 0
was 0
a 0
covert 0
agent 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
was 0
centrally 0
involved 0
in 0
the 1
worst 1
abuses 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
Bush 1
era 1
torture 1
regime. 1

As 0
Miller 0
put 0
it, 0
she 0
was 0
“directly 0
involved 0
in 0
its 0
controversial 0
interrogation 0
program” 0
and 0
had 0
an 0
“extensive 0
role” 0
in 0
torturing 0
detainees. 0

Even 0
more 0
troubling, 0
she 0
“had 0
run 0
a 0
secret 0
prison 0
in 0
Thailand” 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
network 0
of 0
“black 0
sites” 0
“where 0
two 0
detainees 0
were 0
subjected 0
to 0
waterboarding 0
and 0
other 0
harsh 1
techniques.” 1
The 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee’s 0
report 0
on 0
torture 0
also 0
detailed 0
the 0
central 0
role 0
she 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
particularly 1
gruesome 1
torture 1
of 0
detainee 0
Abu 0
Zubaydah. 0

Beyond 0
all 0
that, 0
she 0
played 0
a 0
vital 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
interrogation 0
videotapes 0
that 0
showed 0
the 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
both 0
at 0
the 0
black 0
site 0
she 0
ran 0
and 0
other 0
secret 0
agency 0
locations. 0

The 0
concealment 0
of 0
those 0
interrogation 0
tapes, 0
which 0
violated 0
multiple 0
court 0
orders 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
9/11 0
commission 0
and 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
White 0
House 0
lawyers, 0
was 0
condemned 0
as 0
“obstruction” 0
by 0
commission 0
chairs 0
Lee 0
Hamilton 0
and 0
Thomas 0
Keane. 0

A 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
and 0
grand 0
jury 0
investigated 0
those 0
actions 0
but 0
ultimately 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0

entered 0
the 0
wrong 0

shot 0
a 0

who 0
she 0

however, 0

having 0
her 0

Guyger 0
has 0
been 0
treated 0
as 0
more 0
of 0
a 0
victim 0
than 0
a 0
killer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment 0
was 0
never 0
even 0
searched 0
for 0
evidence, 0
and 0
she 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
“vacate” 0
the 0

without 0
any 0

By 0
not 0

ruined 0
the 0

making 0
it 0

It 0

the 0

not 0

that 0

Last 0

Acosta’s 0
press 0
pass 0
to 0
access 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
was 0
suspended 0
“until 0
further 0

back 0
and 0
forth 0
over 0
the 0
migrant 0
caravan 0
working 0
its 0
way 0
up 0
through 0
Mexico. 0

Trump 0
characterizes 0
the 0
caravan 0
as 0
“an 1
invasion,” 1
a 0
term 0
to 0
which 0
Acosta 0
objected. 0

“Honestly, 0
I 0
think 0

let 0
me 0
run 0
the 0
country 0
and 0
you 0
run 0

the 0

said. 0

The 0

him 0
another 0
question 0
before 0
a 0
female 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
walked 0
over 0
to 0
him. 0

Trump 0
then 0
told 0
him, 0
“That’s 0
enough!” 0

Acosta 0
continued 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
talk 0
as 0
the 0
intern 0
was 0
seen 0
trying 0
to 0
take 0
the 0

from 0
his 0
hand. 0

She 0
grabbed 0
the 0

Acosta 0
wouldn’t 0
give 0
it 0
up 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
brief 0
contact 0
between 0
the 0
two. 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
said 0
the 0
suspension 0
of 0
his 0
press 0
credentials 0
stemmed 0
from 0
his 0
“placing 0
his 0
hands 0
on 0
a 0
young 0
woman 0
just 0
trying 0
to 0
do 0
her 0
job 0
as 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
intern.” 0
She 0
called 0
the 0
behavior 0
“absolutely 1
unacceptable.” 1

Several 0
news 0
outlets 0
accused 0
Sanders 0
of 0
using 0
a 0
“doctored” 0
video 0
as 0
evidence, 0
but 0
the 0
press 0
secretary 0

“We 0

“No, 0

a 0
question 0
whether 0
the 0

women’s 0
stories. 0

“I’ve 0
been 0
smeared, 0

isolated 0
from 0

Dr. 0

I 0

it. 0

My 0

stating 0
I 0

She 0
added: 0
“Four 0
people, 0

fact 0
that 0

nothing 1

the 1

they 1

after 1
it 1

a 1

on 1
the 1

several 1

what 1

what 1

there 1

at 0
her. 0

The 0
alleged 0
incident 0
is 0
just 0
one 0
of 0
several, 0
Austin 0
Monahan 0
warned. 0

State 0
Rep. 0
Debra 0
Hilstrom 0
(D 0
Brooklyn 0
Center) 0
was 0
quick 0
to 0
voice 0
her 0
concern 0
over 0
the 0
accusations, 0
calling 0
on 0
Ellison 0
to 0
“answer 0
these 0
allegations.” 0
DFL 0
endorsed 0
candidate 0
for 0
attorney 0
general 0
of 0
Minnesota 0
Matt 0
Pelikan 0
also 0
reacted 0
to 0
the 0
story, 0
calling 0
the 0
allegations 0
“extremely 1
troubling.” 1
Karen 0
Monahan 0
has 0
also 0
hinted 0
at 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
telling 0
Ellison 0
that 0
her 0
“kids, 0
job, 0
health, 0
finances, 0
humanity 0
was 0
deeply 0
impacted 0
by 0
the 0
abuse 0
you 0
are 0
well 0
aware 0
of.” 0
Karen 0
Monahan 0
claims 0
she 0
has 0
videos, 0
recordings, 0
and 0
messages 0
to 0
prove 0
her 0
story. 0

Ellison 0
has 0
admitted 0
the 0
relationship, 0
but 0
is 0
denying 0
the 0
abuse. 0

And 0
the 0
relationship 0
was 0
clearly 0
real. 0

Karen 0
Monahan, 0
an 0
organizer 0
with 0
the 0
Sierra 0
Club, 0
was 0
in 0
a 0
relationship 0
with 0
Ellison 0
for 0
years. 0

The 0
two 0
are 0
seen 0
together 0
in 0
many 0
of 0
her 0
social 0
media 0
posts, 0
including 0
hiking 0
in 0
together 0
national 0
parks 0
and 0
posing 0
with 0
the 0
Obamas 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Records 0
show 0
she 0
lived 0
in 0
his 0
Minneapolis 0
home 0
before 0
their 0
relationship 0
ended. 0

Ellison, 0
who 0
was 0
previously 0
married 0
to 0
a 0
different 0
woman, 0
is 0
divorced. 0

It's 0
hard 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
really 0
happened 0
in 0
a 0
relationship. 0

And 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
kept 0
it 0
quiet. 0

"Keith 0
Ellison 0
flatly 0
denies 0
allegation 0
that 0
he 0
abused 0
an 0
ex 0
girlfriend. 0

The 0
story 0
had 0
been 0
circulating 0
in 0
MN, 0
and 0
not 0
held 0
up 0
under 0
media 0
scrutiny, 0
so 0
no 0
stories 0
ran. 0

It 0
blew 0
up 0
last 0
night 0
after 0
the 0
ex’s 0
son 0
posted 0
the 0
allegation 0
on 0
Facebook." 0

Dave 0
Weigel. 0

It's 0
not 0
quite 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
for 0
Keith 0
X. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
Ellison 0
has 0
faced 0
misconduct 0
allegations. 0

In 0
2006, 0
a 0
woman 0
named 0
Amy 0
Alexandar 0
claimed 0
that 0
Ellison 0
ostracized 0
her 0
and 0
smeared 0
her 0
name 0
after 0
having 0
an 0
extramarital 0
affair 0
with 0
her 0
in 0
the 0
1990s 0
and 0
then 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
2000s. 0

Ellison 0
in 0
2005 0
filed 0
a 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
her 0
after 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
phone 0
and 0
email 0
harassment. 0

She 0
subsequently 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
him, 0
which 0
a 0
judge 0
denied, 0
ordering 0
her 0
to 0
stop 0
repeating 0
allegations 0
of 0
an 0
affair 0
or 0
intimidation. 0

Ellison 0
subsequently 0
agreed 0
to 0
dismiss 0
his 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
her 0
if 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
contacted 0
him. 0

I'm 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
damage 0
control 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
elections. 0

Ellison 0
won 0
the 0
primary 0
days 0
after 0
the 0
allegations 0
were 0
made 0
public. 0

Of 0
course, 0
accusations 0
does 0
not 0
make 0
one 0
guilty 0
for 0
Ellison 0
anymore 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
for 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

However, 0
at 0
least 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Ellison, 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
women 0
were 0
not 0
scared 0
about 0
their 0
reputation 0
and 0
had 0
any 0
political 0
motive 0
to 0
call 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
file 0
a 0
report. 0

When 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Ellison 0
though, 0
we 0
know 0
he 0
is 0
an 0
effeminate 1
pansy 1
who 0
simply 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
answer 0
to 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
and 0
even 0
seeks 0
security 0
to 0
hide 0
from 0
a 0
female 0
report 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
a 0
camera. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
faced 0
it 0
all 0
and 0
fought 0
back 0
against 0
it. 0

Mueller 0
Submits 0
His 0
Russia 0
Report 0
to 0
Justice 0
Department 0

Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
concluded 0
his 0
22 0
month 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
and 0
submitted 0
a 0
report 0
to 0
Attorney 0
General 0
William 0
Barr 0
on 0
Friday, 0
triggering 0
a 0
clamor 0
from 0
Congress 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
findings. 0

A 0
Justice 0
Department 0
official 0
told 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
that 0
Mueller 0
is 0
not 0
recommending 0
any 0
further 0
indictments. 0

In 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
and 0
House 0
judiciary 0
committees, 0
Barr 0
described 0
Mueller’s 0
submission 0
as 0
a 0
“confidential 0
report 0
explaining 0
the 0
prosecution 0
or 0
declination 0
decisions 0
he 0
has 0
reached.” 0

“I 0
am 0
reviewing 0
the 0
report 0
and 0
anticipate 0
that 0
I 0
may 0
be 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
advise 0
you 0
of 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
principal 0
conclusions 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
weekend,” 0
the 0
letter 0
said. 0

Barr 0
did 0
not 0
detail 0
what 0
the 0
report 0
contains, 0
but 0
did 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
did 0
not 0
overrule 0
any 0
decision 0
Mueller 0
made. 0

Barr 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
consult 0
with 0
Mueller 0
and 0
Deputy 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein, 0
who 0
has 0
mostly 0
overseen 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office, 0
about 0
“what 0
other 0
information 0
from 0
the 0
report” 0
can 0
be 0
released 0
to 0
Congress 0
and 0
the 0
public. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
and 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
lawyers 0
said 0
the 0
next 0
decisions 0
are 0
up 0
to 0
Barr. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
that 0
Barr 0
releases 0
two 0
separate 0
reports. 0

One 0
would 0
summarize 0
Mueller’s 0
findings 0
without 0
including 0
classified 0
information 0
and 0
would 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
Congress 0
and 0
would 0
then 0
most 0
likely 0
find 0
its 0
way 0
out 0
into 0
the 0
public. 0

The 0
other 0
would 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
a 0
smaller 0
group 0
of 0
lawmakers 0
who 0
head 0
major 0
congressional 0
committees, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
House 0
and 0
Senate 0
intelligence 0
committees. 0

Rep. 0
Adam 0
Schiff 0
(D 0
CA), 0
chairman 0
of 0
House 0
Intelligence, 0
called 0
for 0
transparency. 0

“Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
began 0
as 0
a 0
counterintelligence 0
inquiry 0
into 0
whether 0
individuals 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
were 0
compromised 0
by 0
a 0
foreign 0
power. 0

By 0
law, 0
that 0
evidence 0
he 0
uncovered 0
must 0
be 0
shared 0
with 0
our 0
Committee,” 0
he 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
tweet. 0

“And 0
his 0
report 0
must 0
also 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

Now.” 1

Trump 0
has 0
previously 0
said 0
he 0
supports 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
making 0
the 0
report 0
public. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
mind,” 0
he 0
has 0
said. 0

“I 0
mean, 0
frankly, 0
I 0
told 0
the 0
House, 0
‘If 0
you 0
want, 0
let 0
them 0
see 0
it.’” 0

Trump 0
has 0
also 0
vigorously 0
denied 0
any 0
wrongdoing 0
and 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
branded 0
the 0
probe 0
as 0
a 0
“total 1
witch 1
hunt.” 1

Mueller 0
will 0
remain 0
as 0
special 0
counsel 0
for 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
time 0
as 0
he 0
and 0
a 0
small 0
contingent 0
of 0
staff 0
close 0
the 0
office, 0
a 0
Justice 0
Department 0
spokesperson 0
reportedly 0
said. 0

The 0
handover 0
of 0
the 0
report 0
marks 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
that 0
has 0
for 0
nearly 0
two 0
years 0
transfixed 1
the 1
nation, 1
yielded 0
dozens 0
of 0
indictments 0
and 0
convictions, 0
and 0
brought 0
down 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
closest 0
advisers. 0

The 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
was 0
tasked 0
broadly 0
with 0
investigating 0
any 0
links 0
or 0
coordination 0
between 0
the 0
Russian 0
government 0
and 0
individuals 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
any 0
matters 0
that 0
arose 0
directly 0
from 0
the 0
probe. 0

However, 0
the 0
scope 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
seems 0
to 1
have 1
bled 1
outside 1
those 1
lines. 1

Several 0
witnesses, 0
for 0
example, 0
have 0
been 0
questioned 0
about 0
other 0
countries’ 0
efforts 0
to 0
meddle 0
in 0
American 1
politics, 0
including 0
Saudi 0
Arabia, 0
Israel, 0
the 0
UAE 0
and 0
Qatar. 0

So 0
far, 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
has 0
indicted 0
or 0
obtained 0
guilty 0
pleas 0
from 0
34 0
people 0
and 0
three 0
companies. 0

Six 0
of 0
those 0
are 0
former 0
Trump 0
associates, 0
and 0
25 0
of 0
them 0
are 0
Russians. 0

No 0
Americans 0
have 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
conspiring 0
with 0
Russians 0
to 0
meddle 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
elections 0
at 0
least 0
none 0
the 0
public 0
knows 0
about. 0

But 0
major 0
Trumpworld 1
figures 1
were 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
other 0
crimes, 0
including 0
former 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
Michael 0
Flynn, 0
former 0
campaign 0
chairman 0
Paul 0
Manafort, 0
deputy 0
campaign 0
chairman 0
Richard 0
Gates 0
and 0
Trump's 0
former 0
personal 0
lawyer 0
and 0
fixer 0
Michael 0
Cohen. 0

Cohen 0
has 0
been 0
sentenced 0
to 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
crimes 0
he 0
committed 0
while 0
working 0
for 0
Trump, 0
including 0
the 0
payments 0
he 0
made 0
to 0
two 0
adult 0
film 0
star 0
actresses 0
for 0
their 0
alleged 0
affairs 0
with 0
his 0
boss. 0

Manafort 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
both 0
Virginia 0
and 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
will 0
serve 0
about 0
seven 0
years 0
in 0
prison. 0

In 0
Washington, 0
Manafort 0
was 0
sentenced 0
for 0
for 0
conspiring 0
against 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
connected 0
to 0
his 0
covert 0
lobbying 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Ukraine’s 0
former 0
pro 0
Russian 0
government. 0

He 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
Virginia 0
for 0
bank 0
and 0
wire 0
fraud. 0

The 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
court 0
filing 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
gotten 0
all 0
it 0
can 0
out 0
of 0
Flynn, 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
cooperating 0
for 0
months 0
after 0
pleading 0
guilty 0
in 0
December 0
2017 0
to 0
lying 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
about 0
his 0
interactions 0
with 0
Russian 0
Ambassador 0
Sergei 0
Kislyak. 0

It’s 0
unclear 0
when 0
he 0
will 0
be 0
sentenced 0
but 0
his 0
lawyers 0
want 0
to 0
wait 0
until 0
the 0
trial 0
for 0
his 0
former 0
business 0
partners 0
begins 0
in 0
Virginia. 0

Gates 0
has 0
also 0
been 0
cooperating 0
on 0
a 0
wide 0
variety 0
of 0
topics 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation, 0
including 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Manafort. 0

As 0
of 0
March, 0
Gates 0
was 0
still 0
offering 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team 0
information 0
about 0
his 0
time 0
working 0
for 0
Trump. 0

He 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
in 0
February 0
2018 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
and 0
lying 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

Several 0
other 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agencies 0
have 0
picked 0
up 0
pieces 0
of 0
Mueller’s 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
Attorney’s 0
Office 0
for 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
is 0
actively 0
probing 0
the 0
Trump 0
inaugural 0
committee 0
to 0
determine 0
if 0
it 0
received 0
illegal 0
foreign 0
donations 0
and 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
that 0
money 0
flowed 0
through 0
American 0
intermediaries. 0

The 0
Eastern 0
District 0
of 0

has 0
reportedly 0
taken 0
over 0
some 0
aspects 0

that 0
probe. 0

SDNY 0

also 0
looking 0

What 0
makes 0
this 0
recent 0
purge 0
from 0
Facebook 0
and 0
Twitter 0
so 0
egregious 1
is 0
that 0
the 0
pages 0
like 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project, 0
the 0
Anti 0
Media, 0
Press 0
for 0
Truth, 0
and 0
dozens 0
of 0
others, 0
did 0
not 0
fit 0
the 0
hate 0
speech 0
narrative 0
these 0
same 0
companies 0
used 0
to 0
wipe 0
out 0
Alex 0
Jones. 0

Instead, 0
these 0
pages 0
were 0
dedicated 1
to 1
spreading 1
peace, 1
bridging 1
the 1
divide, 1
bringing 1
humanity 1
together 1
and 0
holding 0
government 0
accountable. 0

And 0
how 0
does 0
this 0
poem 0
end, 0
again? 0

The 0
purge 0
happened 0
around 0
12:30 0
p.m. 0
CST 0
with 0
mainstream 0
news 0
reports 0
launching 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
implying 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
given 0
the 0
heads 0
up 0
about 0
the 0
move. 0

In 0
a 0
statement 0
co 0
authored 0
by 0
Facebook 0
Head 0
of 0
Cybersecurity 0
Nathaniel 0
Gleicher 0
who 0
Caitlin 0
Johnstone 0
aptly 0
points 0
out, 0
also 0
happens 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
former 0
White 0

National 0
Security 0
Council 0
Director 0
of 0
Cybersecurity 0
Policy 0
the 0
massive 0
social 0
media 0
platform 0
explained 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
removed 0
“559 0
Pages 0
and 0
251 0
accounts 0
that 0
have 0
consistently 0
broken 0
our 0
rules 0
against 0
spam 0
and 0
coordinated 0
inauthentic 0
behavior.” 0

Facebook 0
said 0
the 0
pages 0
were 0
“working 0
to 0
mislead 0
others 0
about 0
who 0
they 0
are, 0
and 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
doing.” 0
However, 0
this 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
further 0
from 0
the 0
truth. 0

Our 0
names, 0
addresses, 0
and 0
phone 0
numbers 0
were 0
on 0
all 0
of 0
our 0
pages 0
and 0
our 0
profiles. 0

“We 0
were 0
verified 0
by 0
Facebook 0
with 0
a 0
little 0
check 0
mark 0
next 0
to 0
our 0
name, 0
so 0
they 0
know 0
we 0
are 0
a 0
legitimate 0
organization/outlet. 0

They 0
have 0
seen 0
our 0
“Articles 0
of 0
Organization” 0
which 0
was 0
issued 0
by 0
the 0
state 0
of 0
Louisiana, 0
which 0
is 0
where 0
my 0
partner 0
and 0
The 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
co 0
founder 0
lives,” 0
Jason 0
Bassler, 0
co 0
founder 0
of 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
explained. 0

However, 0
in 0
their 0
statement, 0
Facebook 0
then 0
suggested 0
the 0
real 0
reason 0
behind 0
the 0
purge 0
elections 0
are 0
coming 0
and 0
pesky 1
folks 1
like 0
the 0
independent 0
media 0
have 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
reporting 0
information 0
on 0
candidates 0
that 0
the 0
mainstream 0
tends 0
to 0
ignore 0
like 0
war, 0
corruption, 0
and 0
most 0
recently, 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
disdain 0
for 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

“Given 0
the 0
activity 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
and 0
its 0
timing 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
midterm 0
elections 0
we 0
wanted 0
to 0
give 0
some 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
types 0
of 0
behavior 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
this 0
action,” 0
Facebook 0
said, 0
before 0
accusing 0
us 0
of 0
hawking 0
fake 0
products 0
or 0
functioning 0
as 0
ad 0
farms 0
that 0
tricked 0
“people 0
into 0
thinking 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
forums 0
for 0
legitimate 0
political 0
debate.” 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
stated 0
that 0
TFTP 0
never 0
hid 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
worked 0
with 0
other 0
independent 0
media 0
groups 0
to 0
share 0
our 0
information 0
around 0
the 0
web 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
grassroots. 0

But 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
together 0
certainly 0
posed 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
mainstream 0
so 0
this 0
nonsense 1
about 0
tricking 0
people 0
was 0
brought 0
into 0
play. 0

Within 0
all 0
of 0
our 0
pages 0
under 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
umbrella, 0
we 0
had 0
close 0
to 0
6 0
million 0
followers. 0

Does 0
Facebook 0
think 0
it 0
knows 0
better 0
than 0
the 0
6 0
million 0
people 0
who 0
clicked 0
like 0
on 0
our 0
page? 0

We 0
also 0
had 0
close 0
to 0
16,000 0
reviews 0
on 0
our 0
page 0
with 0
an 0
average 0
4.1 0
star 0
rating, 0
directly 0
showing 0
that 0
people 0
desired 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
we 0
were 0
putting 0
out. 0

The 0
only 0
ones 0
manipulating 0
people 0
here 0
are 0
the 0
tech 0
giants 0
themselves. 0

All 0
but 0
proving 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
coordinated 0
attack 0
by 0
the 0
tech 0
giant 0
community, 0
shortly 0
after 0
the 0
purge 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
Twitter 0
followed 0
suit, 0
wiping 0
out 0
our 0
profiles 0
on 0
there 0
as 0
well. 0

They 0
gave 0
absolutely 0
no 0
reason 0
for 0
the 0
suspension. 0

“This 0
signifies 0
a 0
re 0
consolidation 0
of 0
the 0
media. 0

Cable 0
news 0
media 0
controlled 0
the 0
narrative 0
for 0
most 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
but 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
lowered 0
that 0
barrier 0
to 0
entry 0
and 0
allowed 0
the 0
average 0
person 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
media 0
themselves. 0

This 0
obviously 0
took 0
market 0
share 0
and 0
influence 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
traditional 0
media, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
allowed 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
diverse 0
public 0
conversation. 0

Now 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
platforms 0
that 0
have 0
monopolized 0
the 0
industry 0
are 0
favoring 0
mainstream 0
sources 0
and 0
silencing 0
alternative 0
voices. 0

So 0
now, 0
instead 0
of 0
allowing 0
more 0
people 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
voice, 0
these 0
platforms 0
are 0
creating 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
where 0
only 0
powerful 0
media 0
organizations 0
are 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
had 0
on 0
cable 0
news,” 0
John 0
Vibes 0
poignantly 0
noted. 0

The 0
bottom 0
line 0
is 0
that 0
sites 0
like 0
ours 0
and 0
the 0
others 0
who 0
were 0
wiped 0
from 0
the 0
internet 0
yesterday 0
represent 0
a 0
voice 0
against 0
the 0
plutocratic 1
information 1
controlling 1
establishment. 1

We 0
challenge 0
their 0
paradigm 0
of 0
control 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
thorn 0
in 0
their 0
side. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
distinct 0
lines 0
between 0
social 0
media 0
giants 0
and 0
government 0
either 0
which 0
renders 0
the 0
“they 0
are 0
private, 0
they 0
can 0
do 0
what 0
they 0
wish” 0
argument 0
moot. 0

the 0

between 0

as 0
a 0

Indeed, 0
we 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
precipice 0
of 0
corporate 0
state 0
censorship. 0

Those 0
who 0
have 0
constantly 0
demanded 0
that 0
tech 0
giants 0
silence 0
their 0
critics 0
and 0
information 0
that 0
‘offends’ 0
them 0
are 0
finally 0
seeing 0
the 0
inevitable 1
results 0
of 0
such 0
irresponsible 1
acts. 0

As 0
we 0
have 0
been 0
pointing 0
out 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
tech 0
monopolies 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
silence 0
those 0
with 0
whom 0
you 0
disagree, 0
are 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
one 0
day 0
silence 0
you. 0

The 0
silver 0
lining 0
to 0
this 0
massive 0
purge 0
of 0
independent 0

is 0
that 0
it 0

that 0

has 0
concluded 0
and 0
resulted 0

no 0
new 0

by 0
admitting 0
that 0
President 0

won 0
a 0
“huge 1

“He’s 1
been 1

by 0

said 0
of 0
President 0

report. 0

“And 0
then 0
he’s 0

vindicated, 1
exactly,” 0

said. 0

“You 0
know–how 0
do 0
you 0

I 0

we 0
obviously 0

here. 0

We 0

to 0
see 0
what 0
comes 0
out 0
from 0

and 0
what’s 0
in 0

But 0
if 0

“A 0

here,” 0

“The 0

did 0
not 0
have 0
to 0
sit 0
down 0
for 0
an 0
interview. 0

They 1
were 1
so 1
concerned 1
about 1
that, 1
because 1
he’d 1
get 1
caught 1
up 1
in 1
lies–and 1
there’d 1
be 1
perjury 1
traps. 1

Okay, 0
so 0
that’s 0
now 0
over. 0

“We 0
would 0
have 0
greatly 0
preferred 0
to 0

House 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
a 0

we 0

the 0

Oh, 0

there's 0
more. 0

If 0
journalists 0
can't 0
conduct 0
themselves 0

then 0
there 0
is 0
no 0

Seriously! 1

“At 0
this 0

however, 0
we 0
have 0

not 0
to 0
frame 0
such 0
rules 0

the 0
hope 0
that 0

we 0

should 0
be 0
telling 0

where 0

A 0

At 0

official 0
taking 0

the 0

“Yielding 0

the 0

pass. 0

I 1
can 1
see 1
this 1
going 1
way 1
downhill. 1

If 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
people 0
like 0
Acosta, 0
at 0
the 0
moment 0
they 0
begin 0
to 0
show 0
who 0
and 0
what 0
they 0
really 0
are, 0
stop 0
calling 0
on 0
them 0
for 0
questions. 0

This 0
is 0
my 0
advice 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Don't 0
call 0
on 0
Jim 0
Acosta 0
another 0
time 0
for 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
he 0
remains 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Press. 0

Make 0
him 0
regret 0
it 0
the 0
entire 0
time 0
he 0
is 0
there. 0

Bill 0
Clinton 0
insists 0
he 0
doesn't 0
owe 0

an 0
apology 0

Former 0
President 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
insisted 0
in 0
a 0
weekend 0
interview 0
that 0
he 0
doesn't 0
owe 0
a 0
personal 0
apology 0
to 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky, 0
the 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
intern 0
whose 0
adult 0
life 0
has 0
been 0
defined 0
by 0
their 0
inappropriate 1
sexual 0
affair 0
and 0
the 0
global 0
scrutiny 0
that 0
followed. 0

'No,' 0
he 0
told 0
NBC 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
airing 0
Monday 0
on 0
the 0
'Today' 0
show. 0

'I 0
do 0
not 0
– 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
talked 0
to 0
her. 0

But 0
I 0
did 0
say 0
publicly 0
on 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
occasion 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
sorry.' 0

'I 0
apologized 0
to 0
everybody 0
in 0
the 0
world,' 0
Clinton 0
said, 0
implying 0
that 0
was 0
enough. 0

And 0
the 0
flustered 0
former 0
president, 0
more 0
famous 0
for 0
his 0
Don 1
Juan 1
like 1

Her 0
too: 0
Lewinsky 0
has 0
emerged 0
as 0
an 0
anti 0
bullying 0
activist 0
and 0
now 0
says 0
Clinton 0
engaged 0
in 0
a 0
'gross 1
abuse 1
of 1
power' 1
by 0
seducing 0
her 0

'A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
have 0
been 0
omitted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
story 0
work,' 0
he 0
declared, 0
'I 0
think 0
partly 0
because 0
they're 0
frustrated 0
that 0
they 0
got 0
all 0
these 0
serious 0
allegations 0
against 0
the 0
current 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office 0
and 0
his 0
voters 0
don't 0
seem 0
to 0
care.' 0

And 0
Clinton 0
complained 0
in 0
the 0
interview 0
that 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
presidency 0
financially 0
ruined 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
costs 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
legal 0
consequences 0
of 0
his 0
actions. 0

'Nobody 0
believes 0
that 0
I 0
got 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
for 0
free,' 0
he 0
said. 0

'I 0
left 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
$16 0
million 0
in 0
debt,' 0

He's 0
worth 0
about 0
$80 0
million 0
today, 0
aided 0
by 0
an 0
aggressive 0
schedule 0
of 0
speaking 0
events 0
– 0
many 0
of 0
which 0
paid 0
him 0
six 0
figure 0
fees 0
for 0
individual 0
appearances. 0

In 0
a 0
March 0
essay 0
for 0
Vanity 0
Fair 0
magazine, 0
Lewinsky 0
wrote 0
that 0
'what 0
transpired 0
between 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
and 0
myself 0
was 0
not 0
sexual 1
assault, 1
although 0
we 0
now 0
recognize 0
that 0
it 0
constituted 0
a 0
gross 1
abuse 1
of 1
power.' 1

Clinton 0
is 0
now 0
on 0
a 0
book 0
tour 0
with 0
co 0
author 0
James 0
Patterson 0
but 0
got 0
pointed 0
questions 0
from 0
NBC 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Monday 0
morning 0

Clinton, 0
pictured 0
denying 0
his 0
May 0
December 0
affair 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
president, 0
was 0
already 0
noted 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
for 0
his 0
lothario 1
habits 0

But 0
decades 0
later, 0
she's 0
still 0
traumatized 1
by 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
being 0
identifed 0
globally 0
as 0
the 0
your 0
woman 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0

kept 0
on 0

used 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
pleasure 0
just 0
a 0
few 0
feet 0
from 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office. 0

'I’m 0
sorry 0
to 0
say 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
a 0
definitive 0

on 0

all 0
of 0
the 0
events 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
the 0

Lewinsky 0
wrote 0
of 0
the 0
public 1
humiliation 1
that 0
played 0
out 0
in 0
seeming 0
slow 0
motion. 0

'I 0

unpacking 0
and 0
reprocessing 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
me. 0

Over 0
and 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again.' 0

Clinton 0
is 0
launching 0
a 0
book 0
tour 0
to 0
promote 0
'The 0
President 0

Missing,' 0
a 0
fictional 0
political 0
thriller 0
co 0
written 0
with 0
the 0
famed 0
author 0
James 0
Patterson. 0

He 0
accused 0
interviewed 0
Craig 0
Melvin 0
of 0
'ignor[ing] 0
gaping 0
facts 0
in 0
describing 0
this, 0
and 0
I 0
bet 0
you 0
don't 0
know 0
you 0
don't 0
know 0
them.' 0

'This 0
was 0
litigated 0
20 0
years 0
ago. 0

Two 0
thirds 0
of 0
the 1
American 1
people 1
sided 0
with 0
me.' 0

Lewinsky 0
is 0
pictured 0
on 0
September 0
21, 0
1998 0
meeting 0
with 0
then 0
president 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
at 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
function 0

If 0
he 0
were 0
president 0
today, 0
he 0
said 0
later, 0
his 0
most 0
famous 0
extramarital 0
affair 0
wouldn't 0
'be 0
an 0
issue, 0
because 0
people 0
would 0
be 0
using 0
the 0
facts 0
instead 0
of 0
the 0
imagined 0
facts.' 0

Patterson, 0
too, 0
defended 0
Clinton 0
– 0
by 0
comparing 0
his 0
sexual 0
affairs 0
in 0
office 0
with 0
those 0
of 0
two 0
preceding 0
Democratic 0
presidents. 0

'It's 0
20 0
years 0
ago, 0
come 0
on!' 0

he 0
blasted 0
Melvin. 0

'Let's 0
talk 0
about 0
JFK. 0

Let's 0
talk 0
about, 0
you 0
know, 0
LBJ. 0

Stop 0
already!' 0

Clinton 0
piled 0
on. 0

'You 0
think 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
should 0
have 0
resigned? 0

Do 0
you 0
believe 0
President 0
Johnson 0
should 0
have 0
resigned? 0

Someone 0
should 0
ask 0
you 0
these 0
questions 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
way 0
you 0
formulate 0
the 0
questions,' 0
he 0
jabbed. 0

'I 0
dealt 0
with 0
it 0
20 0
years 0
ago, 0
plus.' 0

Suddenly 0
philosophical 0
and 0
seeming 0
to 0
take 0
a 0
longer 0
view 0
of 0
history, 0
Clinton 0
said: 0
'I 0
have 0
tried 0
to 0
do 0
a 0
good 0
job 0
since 0
then 0
with 0
my 0
life 0
and 0
with 0
my 0
work. 0

That's 0
all 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
you.' 0

The 0
Coming 0
Coup 0

The 0
annual 0
budget 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
$1,000 0
billion. 0

This 1
vast 1
sum 1
is 0
drawn 0
from 0
US 0
taxpayers 0
who 0
have 0
many 0
unmet 0
needs. 0

To 0
justify 0
such 1
an 1
enormous 1
budget 1
a 0
major 0
enemy 0
is 0
required. 0

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
and 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
politicians 0
that 0
the 0
complex 0
owns 0
have 0
designated 0
Russia 0
to 0
be 0
that 0
enemy. 0

The 0
complex 0
and 0
its 0
political 0
and 0
media 0
agents 0
will 0
not 0
permit 0
Trump 0
to 0
normalize 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia. 0

To 0
prevent 0
President 0
Trump 0
from 0
reducing 0
the 0
dangerous 0
tensions 0
between 0
nuclear 0
powers 0
that 0
Washington 0
has 0
created, 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
orchestrated 0
Russiagate, 0
a 1
proven 1
hoax, 1
but 0
believed 0
by 0
many 0
due 0
to 0
its 0
endless 0
repetition. 0

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
orchestrated 0
the 0
false 0
indictments 0
of 0
12 0
Russians. 0

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
orchestrated 0
the 0
false 0
arrest 0
of 0
Maria 0
Butina, 0
and 0
so 1
on 1
and 1
on. 1

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
acting 0
through 0
the 0
politicians 0
and 0
presstitutes 0
that 0
it 0
owns 0
and 0
controls 0
has 1
turned 1
the 1
normal 1

of 1
the 1
President 1
one 1
acknowledged 1
and 1
acted 1
upon 1
by 1
every 1

to 1
defuse 1
tensions 1
that 1
could 1
lead 1
to 1

war 1
into 1
a 1

President 1
Trump 1

We 0
are 0
currently 0
experiencing 0
sedition 0
at 0
the 0
highest 0
levels 0
as 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
unfolds 0
its 0
coup 0
against 0
the 0
elected 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

In 1
1961 1
President 1
Dwight 1
Eisenhower 1
warned 1
Americans 1
in 1
his 1
last 1
public 1
address 1
that 1
the 1
military/industrial 1
complex 1
was 1
a 1
threat 1
to 1
American 1
democracy. 1

Truer 0
words 0
were 0
never 0
spoken 0
by 0
an 0
American 0
president. 0

Shortly 0
thereafter, 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
assassinated 0
President 0
John 0
F. 0
Kennedy 0
for 0
working 0
toward 0
peace 0
with 0
Soviet 0
leader 0
Khrushchev. 0

To 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
President 0
Nixon, 0
who 0
made 0
too 0
many 0
arms 0
control 0
agreements 0
with 0
the 0
Soviets 0
and 0
opened 0
to 0
China, 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
used 0
its 0
asset, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
to 0
orchestrate 0
the 0
“Watergate 0
crisis” 0
that 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
used 0
to 0
force 0
Nixon’s 0
resignation. 0

Now 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
openly 0
inciting 0
sedition 0
against 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

If 0
this 0
plot 0
succeeds, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
likely 0
case, 0
America 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
complete 0

all 0

will 0
be 0

13 0

criminal 0

involving 0
a 0
Muslim 0

at 0
Leeds 0
Crown 0
Court. 0

The 0
judge 0
also 0
put 0
a 0
gag 0
on 0
the 0
press 0
so 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
allowed 0
to 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
arrest, 0
and 0
many 0
reputable 0

their 0

Robinson 0
was 0
denied 0
due 0
process, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
judge. 0

Robinson 0
has 0
been 0
at 0
the 0
forefront 0
of 0
exposing 0
the 0
criminal 0
elements 0
in 0
Islam. 0

Just 0
last 0
week 0
I 0
reported 0
on 0
his 0
previous 0
comments 0
about 0
being 0
incarcerated 0
earlier 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
a 0
plot 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
prison. 0

This 0
isn't 0
far 0
fetched. 0

In 0
March, 0
we 0
reported 0
on 0
Britain 0
First's 0
Paul 0
Golding 0
was 0
attacked 0
by 0
two 0
inmates 0
at 0
HMP 0
Elmley, 0
on 0
the 0
Isle 0
of 0
Sheppey, 0
Kent. 0

Golding 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
on 0
7 0
March 0
at 0
Folkestone 0
Magistrates’ 0
Court 0
of 0
religiously 0
aggravated 0
harassment 0
alongside 0
deputy 0
leader 0
Jayda 0
Fransen 0
which 0
they 0
carried 0
out 0
in 0
Kent 0
in 0
May 0
last 0
year. 0

The 0
court 0
heard 0
the 0
pair 0
launched 0
a 0
political 0
campaign 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
trying 0
to 0
expose 0
Muslim 0
men 0
who 0
were 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
a 0
rape 0
trial. 0

So, 0
expose 1
the 1
Islamists 1
fro 1
who 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
Islam's 1
founder 1
not 1
only 1
taught 1
them, 1
but 1
modeled 1
for 1
them, 1
and 0
you 0
may 0
just 0
find 0
yourself 0
in 0
jail 0
in 0
the 0
UK. 0

Sadly, 0
the 0
same 0
scenario 0
is 0
making 0
some 0

are 0
set 0
for 0
this 0
weekend, 0
and 0
Dutch 0
MP 0
Geert 0
Wilders 0
has 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
join 0
those 0
protests. 0

Wilders 0
has 0
called 0
Robinson's 0
imprisonment 0
a 0
"disgrace." 1

He 0
told 0
Breitbart: 0

Tommy 0
Robinson 0
was 0
arrested 0
on 0
May 0
25 0
outside 0
Leeds 0
Crown 0
Court 0
after 0
using 0
social 0
media 0
to 0
broadcast 0
details 0
of 0
an 0
ongoing 0
trial 0
which 0
was 0
subject 0
to 0
reporting 0
restrictions. 0

He 0
was 0
arrested, 0
brought 0
before 0
a 0
judge, 0
and 0
sentenced 0
within 0
five 0
hours. 0

The 0
judge 0
ordered 0
a 0
media 0
ban 0
on 0
his 0
arrest 0
and 0
imprisonment, 0
even 0
forcing 0
British 0
publications 0
to 0
delete 0
their 0
articles 0
about 0
the 0
case. 0

Such 1
measures 1
are 1
common 1
practice 1
in 1
North 1
Korea 1
and 1
Saudi 1
Arabia. 1

It 0
is 0
sad 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
Britain, 0
the 0
cradle 0
of 0
Western 0
democracy 0
and 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
law, 0
is 0
fast 0
descending 1
into 1
tyranny. 1

Tommy 1
is 1
a 1
hero. 1

It 0
is 0
a 0
disgrace 1
that 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
in 0
jail. 0

I 0
have 0
been 0
invited 0

the 0
Central 0

Americans 0
need 0
answers 0
about 0
her 0
past 0
involvement 0
in 0
state 0
sponsored 0
torture 0
programs. 0

As 0
I 0
noted 0
earlier 0
today, 0
Haspel’s 0
long 0
career 0
at 0
the 0
CIA 0
spanned 0
the 0
years 0
of 0
torture 0
carried 0
out 0
under 0
the 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
White 0
House. 0

A 0
2013 0
Washington 0
Post 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
new 0
CIA 0
head 0
called 1
her 1
role 1
in 1
the 1
torture 1
programs 1
of 1
that 1
era 1
“extensive” 1
and 1
noted 1
that 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
she 1
ran 1
a 1
CIA 1
“black 1
site” 1
in 0
Thailand 0
where 0
torture 0
occurred. 0

In 0
a 0
lengthy 0
statement 0
following 0
Haspel’s 0
nomination, 0
McCain 0
expressed 0
big 0
concerns 0
about 0
what 0
it 0
means 0
for 0
the 0
agency’s 0
future, 0
saying: 0

During 0
his 0
own 0
confirmation 0
proceedings 0
for 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
repeatedly 0
committed 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
comply 0
with 0
the 0
law 0
that 0
applies 0
the 0
Army 0
Field 0
Manual’s 0
interrogation 0
requirements 0
to 0
all 0
U.S. 0
agencies, 0
including 0
the 0
CIA. 0

The 0
American 0
people 0
now 0
deserve 0
the 0
same 0
assurances 0
from 0
Gina 0
Haspel, 0
whose 0
career 0
with 0
the 0
agency 0
has 0
intersected 0
with 0
the 0
program 0
of 0
so 0
called 0
‘enhanced 0
interrogation 0
techniques’ 0
on 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
occasions. 0

The 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
in 0
U.S. 0
custody 0
during 0
the 0
last 0
decade 0
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
darkest 1
chapters 1
in 1
American 1
history. 1

Ms. 0
Haspel 0
needs 0
to 0
explain 0
the 0
nature 0
and 0
extent 0
of 0
her 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
interrogation 0
program 0
during 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process. 0

I 0
know 0
the 0
Senate 0
will 0
do 0
its 0
job 0
in 0
examining 0
Ms. 0
Haspel’s 0
record 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
her 0
beliefs 0
about 0
torture 0
and 0
her 0
approach 0
to 0
current 0
law. 0

In 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
the 0
September 0
11th 0
attacks, 0
our 0
government 0
squandered 0
precious 0
moral 0
authority 0
in 0
a 0
futile 1
effort 1
to 0
produce 0
intelligence 0
by 0
means 0
of 0
torture. 0

We 0
are 0
still 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
that 0
desperately 1
misguided 1
decision. 1

Current 0
U.S. 0
law 0
is 0
clear 0
in 0
banning 0
enhanced 0
interrogation 0
techniques. 0

Any 0
nominee 0
for 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
must 0
pledge 0
without 0
reservation 0
to 0
uphold 0
this 0
prohibition, 0
which 0
has 0
helped 0
us 0
to 0
regain 0
our 0
position 0
of 0
leadership 0
in 0
the 0
struggle 0
for 0
universal 0
human 0
rights 0
the 1
struggle 1
upon 1
which 1
this 1
country 1
was 1
founded, 1
and 1
which 1
remains 1
its 1
highest 1
aspiration. 1

Americans 1
who 1
value 1

take 1
this 1

Federal 0
Judge 0
Overrides 0
DOJ 0
& 0
Violates 0
First 0
Amendment: 0
Blocks 0
3D 0
Printed 0
Gun 0
Plans 0

In 0
July, 0
I 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
finally 0
settled 0
with 0
Cody 0
Wilson 0
and 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
over 0
his 0
3D 0
print 0
gun 0
plans 0
being 0
lawful. 0

The 0
DOJ 0
surrendered 0
in 0
the 0
matter 0
and 0
accepted 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
plans 0
are 0
protected 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

However, 0
a 0
federal 0
judge, 0
in 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
brought 0
by 0
eight 0
states 0
and 0
the 0
District 0
of 0
Columbia, 0
has 0
blocked 0
the 0
plans 0
from 0
being 0
released. 0

The 0
judge 0
should 0
understand 0
that 0
these 0
plans 0
are 0
protected 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
way 0
that 0
any 0
other 0
printed 0
material 0
is, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
crime 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
committed 0
by 0
making 0
them 0
available 0
to 0
people 0
online. 0

Second, 0
if 0
that 0
were 0
not 0
enough, 0
we 0
already 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
protects 0
actual 0
arms 0
from 0
restriction 0
and 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
keep 0

reverse 0
the 0

the 0

then 0

if 0
they 0

The 0
eight 0

are 0
the 0
usual 0
suspects, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
District 0

we 0
should 0
note 0
which 0

they 0

claims 0
the 0
settlement 0
is: 0

...in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
Administrative 0
Procedure 0
Act....there 0
is 0
no 0
indication 0
in 0
the 0
settlement 0
agreement 0
or 0
elsewhere 0
that 0
any 0
analysis, 0

or 0
determination 0
was 0
made 0
by 0
the 0
government 0
defendants 0
in 0
consultation 0
with 0
other 0
agencies, 0
before 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
agreed 0
to 0
lift 0
export 0
controls 0
on 0
the 0
downloadable 0
guns. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
agreement 0
states 0
that 0
it 0
"does 0
not 0
reflect 0
any 0
agreed 0
upon 0
purpose 0
other 0
than 0
the 0
desire 0

the 0
Action 0
without 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
expense 0
of 0
further 0
litigation." 0

The 0
lawsuit 0
also 0
argues 0
the 0
settlement 0
violates 0
the 0
Tenth 0
Amendment 0
by 0
infringing 0
on 0
states' 0
rights 0
to 0
regulate 0
firearms. 0

Washington 0
has 0
a 0
robust 0
regulatory 0
system 0
meant 0
to 0
keep 0
firearms 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
dangerous 0
individuals. 0

That 0
system 0
is 0
jeopardized 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration's 0
action 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
undermined 0
by 0
the 0
distribution 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed's 0
downloadable 0
guns. 0

Note 0
that 0
Ferguson 0
forgets 0
that 0
the 0
Tenth 0
Amendment 0
states 0
plainly: 0

The 0
powers 0
not 0
delegated 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
by 0
the 0
Constitution, 0
nor 0
prohibited 0
by 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
States, 0
are 0
reserved 0
to 0
the 0
States 0
respectively, 0
or 0
to 0
the 0
people. 0

(emphasis 0
mine) 0

Since 0
our 0
founders 0
clearly 0
said 0
that 0
our 0
rights 0
come 0
from 0
our 0
Creator, 0
and 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
the 0
"right 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
bear 0
arms 0
shall 0
not 0
be 0
infringed," 0
I 0
truly 0
wonder 0
where 0
he 0
gets 0
this 0
idea 0
the 0
state 0
has 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
do 0
just 0
that, 0
infringe 1
on 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
by 1
regulating 1
firearms. 1

he 0
is 0
reading 0
something 0
into 0
it 0
that 0
is 0
simply 0
not 0
there, 0
but 0
that's 0
a 0
Communist 1
ideology 0
you 0
are 0
seeing 0
there, 0
not 0
an 0
American 1
one. 0

Defense 0

Josh 0
Blackman, 0
one 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed's 0
lawyers, 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
today 0
that 0
"The 0
District 0

in 0
Washington 0
already 0
approved 0
the 0

This 0

another 0

on 0
a 0

in 0
the 0

As 0
reported 0
yesterday, 0
Defense 0

is 0
already 0
embroiled 0
in 0
its 0
own 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
New 0

Los 0

over 0
those 0

simultaneously 0

a 0

(Both 0

today's 0

of 0
Washington.) 0

While 0
the 0
various 0
court 0
filings 0
about 0
this 0
continue 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
August 0
1 0
is 0
the 0
date 0
on 0
which 0
Defense 0

will 0
begin 0
distributing 0
the 0

which, 0
again, 0
the 0
settlement 0
legally 0
permits 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
distribution 0
is 0
already 0
happening. 0

Cody 0
Wilson 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
is 0
already 0
fundraising 0
off 0
the 0
suit 0
via 0
Twitter. 0

He 0
told 0
me 0
five 0
years 0
ago, 0
when 0
I 0
was 0
writing 0
a 0
feature 0
story 0
on 0
the 0
beginnings 0
of 0
his 0
fight 0
with 0
the 0
government 0
over 0
gun 0
making 0
files, 0
that 0
"This 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
continuous 0
process 0
of 0
different 0

figures 0
trying 0
to 0

we 0

because 0
you 0

stop 0
me. 0

That 0
seemed 0
natural 0
and 0
ended 0
up 0
being 0
true." 0

So 0
far, 0
that 0
has 0
continued 0
to 0
be 0
true. 0

This 1
federal 1
judge 1
should 1
know 1
what 1
the 1

IN 0
MAY 0
2013, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
Greg 0
Miller 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
clandestine 0
service 0
was 0
being 0
shifted 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“a 0
management 0
shake 0
up” 0
by 0
then 0
Director 0
John 0
Brennan. 0

As 0
Miller 0
documented, 0
this 0
official 0
whom 0
the 0
paper 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
because 0
she 0
was 0
a 0
covert 0
agent 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
was 0
centrally 0
involved 0
in 0
the 1
worst 1
abuses 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
Bush 1
era 1
torture 1
regime. 1

As 0
Miller 0
put 0
it, 0
she 0
was 0
“directly 0
involved 0
in 0
its 0
controversial 0
interrogation 0
program” 0
and 0
had 0
an 0
“extensive 0
role” 0
in 0
torturing 0
detainees. 0

Even 0
more 0
troubling, 0
she 0
“had 0
run 0
a 0
secret 0
prison 0
in 0
Thailand” 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
network 0
of 0
“black 0
sites” 0
“where 0
two 0
detainees 0
were 0
subjected 0
to 0
waterboarding 0
and 0
other 0
harsh 1
techniques.” 1
The 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee’s 0
report 0
on 0
torture 0
also 0
detailed 0
the 0
central 0
role 0
she 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
particularly 1
gruesome 1
torture 1
of 0
detainee 0
Abu 0
Zubaydah. 0

Beyond 0
all 0
that, 0
she 0
played 0
a 0
vital 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
interrogation 0
videotapes 0
that 0
showed 0
the 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
both 0
at 0
the 0
black 0
site 0
she 0
ran 0
and 0
other 0
secret 0
agency 0
locations. 0

The 0
concealment 0
of 0
those 0
interrogation 0
tapes, 0
which 0
violated 0
multiple 0
court 0
orders 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
9/11 0
commission 0
and 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
White 0
House 0
lawyers, 0
was 0
condemned 0
as 0
“obstruction” 0
by 0
commission 0
chairs 0
Lee 0
Hamilton 0
and 0
Thomas 0
Keane. 0

A 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
and 0
grand 0
jury 0
investigated 0
those 0
actions 0
but 0
ultimately 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

The 0
name 0
of 0
that 0
CIA 0
official 0
whose 0
torture 0
activities 0
the 0
Post 0
described 0
is 0
Gina 0
Haspel. 0

Today, 0
as 0
BuzzFeed’s 0
Jason 0
Leopold 0
noted, 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
announced 0
that 0
Haspel 0
was 0

on 0
Thursday 0
announced 0
the 0
findings 0
of 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
they 0
executed 0
on 0
the 0
home 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
gunned 0
down 0
in 0
his 0
apartment 0
by 0
one 0
of 0
their 0
own. 0

The 0
department 0
is 0
now 0
accused 0
of 0
trying 0
to 0
“smear” 1
Jean 0
by 0
claiming 0
they 0
found 0
a 0
tiny 1
bit 1
of 0
marijuana 0
in 0
his 0
house 0
as 0
if 0
this 0
justifies 0
going 0
into 0
someone’s 0
home 0
and 0
murdering 0
them. 0

The 0
timing 0
couldn’t 0
have 0
been 0
more 0
insidiously 0
planned 0
as 0
police 0
released 0
the 0
affidavit 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
funeral 0
despite 0
having 0
allegedly 0
found 0
the 0
marijuana 0
last 0
week. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
affidavit, 0
when 0
they 0
searched 0
his 0
home, 0
police 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
found 0
10.4 0
grams 0
of 0
pot 0
less 0
than 0
half 0
an 0
ounce. 0

Police 0
also 0
said 0
they 0
found 0
two 0
fired 0
cartridge 0
casings, 0
a 0
police 0
backpack 0
and 0
vest, 0
and 0
a 0
metal 0
marijuana 0
grinder 0
the 1
horror. 1

Even 1
if 1
police 1
did 1
find 1
marijuana, 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
would 1
they 1
execute 1
a 1
search 1
warrant 1
on 1
an 1
innocent 1
dead 1
man’s 1
home 1
and 1
then 1
release 1
that 1
information 1

“They 0
[police] 0
immediately 0
began 0
looking 0
to 0
smear 1
him,” 0
attorney 0
Lee 0
Merritt 0
said. 0

“I 0
think 0
it’s 0
unfortunate 1
that 0
law 0

begin 0

immediately 0
criminalize 0
the 0

in 0

that 0

absolutely 0
no 0

that 0
he 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
his 0
home,” 0
Merritt 0
added 0
to 0
Fox 0
4. 0

Pointing 0
out 0
the 0
glaring 1
nature 0
of 0
the 0
smear 1
campaign 0
was 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
absolutely 0
zero 0
information 0
released 0
about 0
the 0
warrants 0
conducted 0
on 0
officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
the 0
killer 1
cop 1
who 0
lived 0
just 0
below 0
Jean. 0

“I 0
would 0
love 0
to 0
see 0
more 0
information 0
coming 0
out 0
about 0
the 0
warrants 0
executed 0
on 0
the 0
home 0
of 0
the 0
shooter 0
who 0
lived 0
just 0
below 0
him. 0

I 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any 0
of 0
those,” 0
said 0
Merritt. 0

Merritt 0
accused 0
the 0
department 0
of 0
conducting 0
a 0
“common 0
assassination 0
attempt 0
on 0
the 0
victim 0
that 0
we 0
often 0
see 0
in 0
law 0
enforcement 0
involved 0
shootings.” 0
Sadly, 0
he 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
correct 0
in 0
his 0
accusations. 0

It 0
is 0
standard 0
procedure 0
for 0
police 0
to 0
dig 1
up 1
dirt 1
on 1
their 0
victims 0
in 0
attempts 0
to 0
smear 1
and 0
assassinate 0
their 0
character 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
killer 1
cops 1
look 0
good 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
eye. 0

Even 0
sadder, 0
however, 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
these 0
smear 1
campaigns 0
work 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
time. 0

As 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
reported 0
on 0
Wednesday, 0
according 0
to 0
police 0
who 0
continue 0
to 0
attempt 0
to 0
spin 0
this 0
story 0
into 0
some 0
tragic 0
mistake 0
Guyger 0
accidentally 0
went 0
into 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment, 0
mistook 0
Jean 0
for 0
an 0
intruder 0
and 0
killed 0
him. 0

“Guyger 0
entered 0
the 0
building 0
and 0
walked 0
down 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
hallway 0
to 0
what 0
she 0
thought 0
was 0
her 0
apartment,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
arrest 0
warrant 0
made 0
public 0
Monday 0
afternoon. 0

“She 0
inserted 0
a 0
unique 0
door 0
key, 0
with 0
an 0
electronic 0
chip, 0
into 0
the 0
door 0
keyhole. 0

The 0
door, 0
which 0
was 0
slightly 0
ajar 0
prior 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
arrival, 0
fully 0
opened 0
under 0
the 0
force 0
of 0
the 0
key 0
insertion.” 0

“Guyger 0
drew 0
her 0
firearm, 0
gave 0
verbal 0
commands 0
that 0
were 0
ignored 0
by 0
… 0
Jean,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
warrant. 0

“Guyger 0
fired 0
her 0
handgun 0
two 0
times 0
striking 0
[Jean] 0
in 0
the 0
torso. 0

Guyger 0
entered 0
the 0
apartment, 0
immediately 0
called 0
911, 0
requesting 0
police 0
and 0
EMS, 0
and 0
provided 0
first 0
aid 0
to 0
… 0
Jean. 0

“Due 0
to 0
the 0
interior 0
darkness 0
of 0
the 0
apartment, 0
Guyger 0
turned 0
on 0
the 0
interior 0
lights 0
while 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
with 0
911. 0

Upon 0
being 0
asked 0
where 0
she 0
was 0
located 0
by 0
emergency 0
dispatchers, 0
Guyger 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
front 0
door 0
to 0
observe 0
the 0
address 0
and 0
discovered 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
arrest 0
warrant. 0

At 0
no 0
time, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
warrant, 0
does 0
Guyger 0
say 0
what 0
“verbal 0
commands” 0
she 0
gave. 0

What’s 0
more, 0
any 0
verbal 0
commands 0
she 0
did 0
give 0
were 0
entirely 0
irrelevant 0
as 0
she 0
was 0
the 0
intruder 0
not 0
Jean. 0

Attempting 0
to 0
imply 0
that 0
Jean 0
was 0
somehow 0
at 0
fault 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
death 0
for 0
disobeying 0
the 0
commands 0
of 0
a 0
homicidal 1
cop 1
who’d 0
just 0
illegally 0
broken 0
into 0
his 0
home 0
is 0
as 0
irresponsible 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
reprehensible. 0

What’s 0
more, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
attorneys 0
for 0
Jean, 0
when 0
Guyger 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
with 0
police, 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address 0
of 0
the 0
apartment 0
implying 0
that 0
she 0
knew 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

“From 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
when 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
an 0
affidavit 0
and 0
I’m 0
thinking 0
that 0
I’m 0
at 0
my 0
house 0
and 0
I 0
call 0
911 0
because 0
someone 0
was 0
just 0
shot,” 0
Attorney 0
Daryl 0
Washington 0
said. 0

“Well, 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
thing 0
that 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
I’m 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
and 0
look 0
at 0
my 0
address? 0

I’m 0
going 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
my 0
address 0
right 0
there 0
on 0
the 0
phone. 0

I’m 0
going 0
to 0
say 0
I’m 0
on 0
the 0
phone. 0

My 0
address 0
is 0
this. 0

Why 0
did 0
she 0
have 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address? 0

It 0
makes 0
no 0
sense 0
whatsoever.” 0

Even 0
more 0
ominous 1
than 0
having 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
according 0
to 0
witnesses, 0
Guyger’s 0
story 0
of 0
inserting 0
the 0
key 0
into 0
Jean’s 0
door 0
and 0
it 0
opening 0
up 0
was 0
simply 0
not 0
true. 0

According 0
to 0
witnesses, 0
Guyger 0
was 0
banging 0
on 0
Jean’s 0
door, 0
demanding 0
he 0
let 0
her 0
in. 0

“Independent 0
witnesses 0
have 0
already 0
come 0
forward 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
they 0
heard 0
this 0
officer 0
pounding 0
on 0
the 0
door 0
and 0
demanding 0
to 0
be 0
let 0
in,” 0
Lee 0
Merritt, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
attorneys 0
representing 0
the 0
Jean 0
family, 0
told 0
ABC 0
News. 0

“The 0
contradictions 0
begin 0
to 0
build 0
from 0
there.” 0

The 0
doors 0
in 0
the 0
complex 0
are 0
also 0
equipped 0
with 0
an 0
automatic 0
closing 0
mechanism. 0

This 0
was 0
demonstrated 0
by 0
the 0
attorneys 0
who 0
opened 0
the 0
door 0
and 0
released 0
it 0
several 0
times 0
showing 0
that 0
it 0
closed 0
every 0
single 0
time 0
blowing 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
door 0
was 0
somehow 0
ajar 0
completely 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
water. 0

Jean’s 0
family 0
also 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
incredibly 0
unlikely 0
for 0
Guyger 0
to 0
mistake 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
for 0
her 0
own 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
distinct 0
red 0
door 0
mat 0
which 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
enough 0
for 0
the 0
cop 0
to 0
know 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
place. 0

shame, 0

her 0

summed 0
up 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0

campaign 0
quite 0
succinctly. 0

to 0

to 0

a 0
tiny 0
bit 0
of 0

she 0

out 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
also 0
a 0
homicidal 1

inside 0

"The 1

a 1

that 0

that 0
this 1
was 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
"domestic 1

"None 0

"Because 1
it's 1
a 1
Muslim 1

the 1

that 1
are 1

they 1

continue 1

put 1
their 1
heads 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
all 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
because 1
they 1
know 1
"nice" 1
Muslim 1
people, 1
but 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
Islam 1
is 1
anything 1
but 1
nice, 1
polite, 1
just 1
or 1
holy 1
. 1

It 1
is 1
a 1
totalitarian, 1
religious/political 1
construct 1
that 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
oppression. 1

When 0
you 0

you 0

exactly 0
what 0

Paul: 0
I'll 0
Do 0
"Whatever 0
It 0
Takes" 0
To 0
Block 0
Haspel 0
& 0
Pompeo 0

Senator 0
Rand 0
Paul 0
(R 0
KY) 0
has 0
expressed 0
some 0
of 0
my 0
thoughts 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
newly 0
nominated 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
and 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
Central 0
Intelligence 0
Agency. 0

Paul 0
told 0
CNN’s 0
“State 0
of 0
the 0
Union” 0
and 0
CBS 0
News’ 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation” 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
do 0
"whatever 0
it 0
takes," 0
including 0
a 0
filibuster, 0
to 0
block 0
the 0
confirmations 0
of 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
to 0
head 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
and 0
Gina 0
Haspel 0
to 0
run 0
the 0
CIA. 0

“You 1
really 1
want 1
a 1
diplomat 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
State 1
Department, 1
not 1
someone 1
who 1
is 1
advocating 1
for 1
war,” 1
he 0
told 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation.” 0

“I 0
frankly 0
think 0
that 0
Pompeo’s 0
positions 0
are 0
too 0
much 0
of 0
an 0
advocate 0
for 0
regime 0
change, 0
really 0
everywhere,” 0
he 0
added. 0

"I 0
don't 0
think 0
our 0
policy 0
ought 0
to 0
be 0
for 0
regime 0
change, 0
so 0
I 0
think 0
Pompeo 1
really 1
isn't 1
a 1
good 1
fit 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
diplomat." 1

He's 0
right, 0
too. 0

Pompeo 0
has 0
advocated 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
North 0
Korea. 0

We've 0
seen 0
exactly 0
what 0
happens 0
when 0
the 0
US 0
gets 0
involved 0
in 0
such 0
types 0
of 0
regime 0
changes, 0
and 0
the 0
truth 0
is 0
that 0
they 0
really 0
don't 0
work 0
out 0
too 0
well. 0

As 0
for 0
Haspel, 0
Paul 0
told 0
"Face 0
The 0
Nation," 0
"She 0
oversaw 0
an 0
illegal 0
black 0
ops 0
operation 0
in 0
Thailand 0
that 0
included 0
torture. 0

I 1
don't 1
think 1
torture 1
is 1
what 1
America 1
is 1
about." 1

On 0
"State 0
of 0
the 0
Union," 0
Paul 0
added, 0
"I'll 0
do 0
whatever 0
it 0
takes, 0
and 0
that 0
includes 0
filibuster" 0
to 0
block 0
their 0
confirmation. 0

"I 0
don't 0
have 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
stop 0
her 0
nomination," 0
he 0
said 0
of 0
Haspel. 0

"There's 0
enough 0
votes 0
she'll 0
eventually 0
win. 0

Few 1
things 1
in 1
life 1
. 1

. 1

. 1

[are] 1
worth 1
standing 1
up 1
saying 0
'enough 1
is 1
enough.'" 1

"We 1
are 1
not 1
a 1
people 1
that 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
fearful 1
or 1
vengeful 1
that 1
we 1
think 1
that 1
torture 1
is 1
somehow 1
acceptable," 1
he 0
added. 0

"On 0
what 0
level 0
could 0
torture 0
ever 0
be 0
acceptable? 0

We 1
should 1
make 1
a 1
stand 1
on 1
this. 1

She 1
should 1
never 1
lead 1
the 1
CIA." 1

Both 0
nominations 0
may 0
face 0
tough 0
confirmation 0
hearings, 0
but 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
many 1
Americans 1
are 1
just 1
fine 1
with 1
these 1
types 1
of 1
people 1
being 1
in 1
these 1
types 1
of 1
offices. 1

The 0
only 0
thing 0
I 0
can 0
think 0
for 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
reasoning 0
is 0
that 0
people 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
their 1
Constitution 1
and 1
understand 1
exactly 1
what 1
Senator 1
Paul 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
warn 1
America 1
about. 1

Instead, 0
people 0
are 0
acting 0
out 0
of 0
emotion 0
and 0
fear. 0

Do 0
I 0
believe 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
concerned 0
about 0
North 0
Korea? 0

Sure, 0
but 0
I'm 0
hardly 0
worried 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
actually 0
attack 0
us. 0

Am 0
I 0
concerned 0
about 0
jihadis? 0

Yep, 0
but 0
I'm 0
not 0
sure 0
I've 0
seen 0
any 0
real 0
hard 0
evidence 0
that 0
torturing 0
them 0
has 0
produced 0
any 0
information 0
that 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
stopping 0
terror 0
attacks. 0

And 0
before 0
you 0
tell 0
me 0
about 0
the 0
media 0
reports 0
and 0
CIA 0
involvement, 0
just 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
a 1
former 1
journalist, 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
dead, 1
told 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
the 1
media 1
lies 1
for 1
the 1
CIA. 1

So, 1
I'm 1
wary 1
of 1
media 1
reports 1
that 1
claim 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
results 1
from 1
the 1
tactics 1
used. 1

Trump 1
has 1
obviously 1
had 1
praise 1
for 1
both 1
Pompeo 1
and 1
Haspel, 1
but 1
then 1
again, 1
his 1
administration 1
has 1
quite 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
turn 1
over 1
too. 1

Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
will 0
become 0
our 0
new 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

He 1
will 1
do 1
a 1
fantastic 1
job! 1

Thank 0
you 0
to 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
for 0
his 0
service! 0

Gina 0
Haspel 0
will 0
become 0
the 0

Common 0
Cause, 0
a 0

group, 0
claimed 0
in 0
the 0
suit 0
that 0
Kemp, 0
while 0
secretary 0
of 0
state, 0
failed 0
to 0
maintain 0
“the 0
security 0
of 0
voter 0
information 0
despite 0
known 0
vulnerabilities” 0
leading 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
midterm. 0

The 1
suit 1
blasted 1
the 1
state’s 1
“provisional 1
ballot 1
scheme,” 1
that 1
could 1
disenfranchise 1
a 1
registered 1
voter 1
at 1
the 1
ballot 1
box. 1

suit 1
pointed 1
out 1
cases 1

around 1
after 1
computer 1

and 1
cases 1
where 1

were 1
not 1

voted 1
for 1

and 1
was 1
“disturbed” 1
to 1

The 0
court 0
ruled 0
that 0

Note 0
the 0
claims 0
– 0
utterly 1
disingenuous, 1
as 0
it 0
turns 0
out 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
labeling 0
of 0
certain 0
people 0
or 0
groups 0
as 0
“violent 1
extremists” 1
is 0
entirely 0
due 0
to 0
their 0
own 0
behavior; 0
in 0
other 0
words, 0
don’t 0
worry, 0
folks, 0
it’s 0
all 0
scientifically 0
objective. 0

This 0
research 0
is 0
being 0
used 0
to 0
advise 0
companies 0
who 0
host 0
online 0
platforms, 0
such 0
as 0
Facebook, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
governments, 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
stamp 0
out 0
online 0
radicalization 0
– 0
using 0

such 0
as 0
working 0

that 0

in 0
some 0
way, 0
or 0
offering 0
them 0
alternative 0
“nice” 0
things 0
to 0
look 0
at. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
seriously 0
important 0
issue. 0

The 0
people 0
and 0
political 0
powers 0
behind 0
such 0
initiatives 0
are 0
manipulating 0
behavior 0
online 0
and 0
literally 0
controlling 0
how 0
people 0
think 0
and 0
get 0
information. 0

They 0
are 0
the 0
appointed 0
guardians 0
of 0
the 0
online 0
hoi 0
polloi. 0

But 0
who 1
guards 1
the 1
guardians? 1

For 0
if 0
Dr. 0
Ganesh 0
is 0
in 0
charge, 0
we 0
have 0
some 0
very 0
worrying 0
questions 0
to 0
ask. 0

One 0
could 0
start 0
from 0
the 0
observation 0
that 0
the 0
article 0
is 0
certainly 0
not 0
an 0
academic 0
piece, 0
and 0
gives 0
no 0
concrete 0
evidence 0
for 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
sweeping 0
claims 0
it 0
makes 0
about 0
the 0
so 0
called 0
“alt 0
right” 0
and 0
the 0
“manosphere”; 0
nor 0
does 0
it, 0
as 0
any 0
academic 0
should 0
do, 0
attempt 0
to 0
test 0
ideas 0
and 0
consider 0
alternative 0
explanations. 0

(Oddly 0
enough, 0
this 0
makes 0
it 0
rather 0
like 0
the 0
groups 0
it 0
claims 0
to 0
criticize.) 0

And 0
the 0
label 0
of 0
“violent 1
extremist” 1
turns 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
used 0
very 0
generously. 0

Ganesh 0
makes 0
wild 1
leaps 0
and 0
inferences. 0

He 0
talks 0
of 0
Darren 0
Osborne, 0
the 0
perpetrator 0
of 0
the 0
vehicular 0
attack 0
on 0
Finsbury 0
Park 0
Mosque. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
heinous 1
crime, 0
and 0
should 0
rightly 0
be 0
condemned. 0

But 0
why 0
did 0
Osborne 0
do 0
this, 0
according 0
to 0
Ganesh? 0

The 0
attack 0
“was 0
executed 0
after 0
he 0
had 0
become 0
indignant 0
after 0
watching 0
a 0
BBC 0
broadcast 0
on 0
child 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
and 0
turned 0
to 0
social 0
media 0
to 0
make 0
sense 0
of 0
it. 0

He 0
found 0
a 0
narrative 0
from 0
British 0
counter 0
jihad 0
groups 0
closely 0
aligned 0
with 0
the 0
alt 0
right, 0
such 0
as 0
Britain 0
First 0
and 0
the 0
founder 0
of 0
the 0
English 0
Defence 0
League 0
Tommy 0
Robinson.” 0
The 0
British 0
counter 0
jihad 0
movement 0
is 0
thus 0
swept 0
into 0
the 0
same 0
group 0
of 0
violent 1
extremists 1
as 0
Osborne, 0
because 0
Ganesh 0
“knows” 1
they 0
encouraged 0
him. 0

The 0
BBC 0
broadcast 0
was 0
the 0
drama 0
based 0
on 0
real 0
life, 0
Three 0
Girls, 0
which 0
showed 0
real 0
life 0
events 0
of 0
three 0
of 0
the 0
(very 0
many) 0
victims 0
of 0
the 0
Rochdale 0
Muslim 0
rape 0
gangs. 0

Ganesh 0
somehow 0
knows 0
precisely 0
what 0
went 0
on 0
in 0
Osborne’s 0
mind. 0

Rather 0
than 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
outrage 0
at 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
the 0
gangs 0
of 0
Muslim 0
men 0
of 0
Pakistani 0
background 0
who 0
abused 0
the 0
girls 0
portrayed 0
in 0
Three 0
Girls 0
that 0
caused 0
Osborne 0
to 0
lose 0
his 0
mind 0
and 0
commit 0
his 0
terrible 1
crime, 0
Ganesh 0
blames 0
Obsorne’s 0
act 0
on 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
Tommy 0
Robinson. 0

Yet 0
Robinson 0
explicitly 0
fights 0
AGAINST 1
political 0
violence. 0

What 1
“narrative 1
from 1
British 1
counter 1
jihad 1
groups” 1
can 1
one 1
find 1
which 1
suggests 1
driving 1
vehicles 1
into 1
innocent 1
Muslims 1
standing 1
outside 1
a 1
mosque? 1

I’m 0
sure 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
any, 0
Ganesh 0
would, 0
as 0
a 0
researcher 0
at 0
an 0
elite 0
institution, 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
it. 0

But 0
there 1
is 1
none 1
offered 1
– 0
only 0
surmise 0
and 0
Ganesh’s 0
mindreading 0
techniques. 0

I 0
suppose 0
if 0
you’re 0
paid 0
to 0
fight 0
online 0
extremism, 0
you’d 0
better 0
find 0
it, 0
or 0
you’re 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
job 0
and 0
short 0
of 0
academic 0
publication. 0

We 0
have 0
also 0
the 0
ridiculous 1
idea 0
that 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
“alt 0
right.” 0
He, 0
in 0
fact, 0
describes 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
centrist 0
– 0
he’s 0
said 0
he 0
agrees 0
with 0
Labour 0
on 0
some 0
things, 0
the 0
Tories 0
on 0
other 0
things, 0
and 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
EDL 0
precisely 0
because 0
he 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
infiltration 0
by 0
the 0
far 0
right. 0

He 0
shows 0
no 0
hint 0
of 0
racism 0
or 0
of 0
white 0
supremacism. 0

Is 0
it 0
simply 0
a 0
coincidence 0
that 0
Tommy 0

that 0

it 0

“I 0

Wednesday. 0

is 0
the 0
first 0
Republican 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
will 0
attempt 0
to 0

but 0
he 0
isn’t 0
the 0
first 0
Republican 0
to 0
express 0
concern. 0

Sen. 0
John 0

of 0

said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
wanted 0
answers 0
about 0
Haspel’s 0
background 0
running 0
CIA 0
torture 0
programs 0
prior 0
to 0
her 0
confirmation. 0

Paul 0
contends 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
nominations 0
directly 0
contradict 0
promises 0
the 0
president 0
made 0
on 0
the 0
campaign 0
trail. 0

“I’m 0
perplexed 1
by 1
the 0

of 0
people 0
who 0
love 1
the 1
Iraq 1
War 1
so 0
much 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
advocate 0
for 0
a 0
war 0
with 0
Iran 0
next. 0

I 0
think 0
it 0
goes 0
against 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
President 0
Trump 0
campaigned 0
on,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
lawmaker 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
can’t 0
support 0
Haspel, 0
whom 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
having 0
expressed 0
“joyful 1
glee” 1
at 0
being 0
involved 0
in 0

in 0

“I 1
find 1

out 0
an 0

for 0

that 0
states 0
there 0
is 0
a 0

surrounded 0
by 0

and 0
an 0
earthen 0
berm 0
in 0

that 0

including 0
39 0

who 0

wanted 0
for 0

and 0
3 0
year 0
old 0
AG 0
Wahhaj, 0
the 0
child 0
that 0
was 0
abducted. 0

This 0
warrant 0
came 0
after 0
a 0
two 0
month 0
investigation 0
in 0
conjunction 0
with 0
Clayton 0
County, 0
Georgia 0
and 0
FBI 0
investigators. 0

According 0
to 0
Sheriff 0
Hogrefe 0
the 0
FBI 0
had 0
recently 0
provided 0
information 0
and 0
surveillance 0
on 0
this 0

but 0
they 0
(FBI) 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
there 0
was 0
enough 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
get 0
on 0
the 0
property. 0

In 0
the 0
press 0
release 0
Sheriff 0
Hogrefe 0
said, 0
“That 0
all 0
changed 0
for 0
me 0
when 0
a 0
message 0
was 0
forwarded 0
to 0
us 0
from 0
a 0
Georgia 0
Detective 0
that 0
we 0
reasonably 0
believed 0
came 0
from 0
someone 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
– 0
the 0
message 0
sent 0
to 0
a 0
third 0
party 0
simply 0
said 0
in 0
part 0
“we 0
are 0
starving 0
and 0
need 0
food 0
and 0
water”. 0

I 0
absolutely 0
knew 0
that 0
we 0
couldn’t 0
wait 0
on 0
another 0
agency 0
to 0
step 0
up 0
and 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
go 0
check 0
this 0
out 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible, 0
so 0
I 0
began 0
working 0
on 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
right 0
after 0
I 0
got 0
that 0
intercepted 0
message 0
– 0
it 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
and 0
a 0
tactical 0
approach 0
for 0
our 0
own 0
safety 0
because 0
we 0
had 0
learned 0
the 0
occupants 0
were 0
most 0
likely 0
heavily 0
armed 0
and 0
considered 0
extremist 1
of 1
the 1
Muslim 1
belief. 1

We 0
also 0
knew 0
from 0
the 0
layout 0
of 0
the 0
compound 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
an 0
advantage 0
if 0
we 0
didn’t 0
deploy 0
tactfully 0
and 0
quickly.” 0

eight 0

Team 0
(SRT) 0
were 0
assisted 0
by 0
four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
OSI 0
unit 0
when 0
they 0
executed 0
the 0

The 0
“all 0

operation 0
went 0
without 0
major 0

but 0
when 0

both 0
men 0
initially 0
refused 0
to 0
follow 0
verbal 0
direction 0
and 0
Wahhaj 0
who 0
was 0
held 0
up 0
inside 0
the 0

was 0
heavily 0
armed 0
with 0
an 0
AR15 0
rifle, 0
five 0
loaded 0
30 0
round 0
magazines, 0

four 0
loaded 0
pistols, 0
including 0
one 0
in 0
his 0
pocket 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
taken 0
down. 0

Many 0
more 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammo 0
were 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
makeshift 0
compound 0
that 0
consists 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
travel 0
trailer 0
buried 0
in 0
the 0
ground 0
covered 0
by 0
plastic 0
with 0
no 0
water, 0
plumbing, 0
or 0
electricity. 0

“The 0
only 0
food 0
We 0
saw 0
were 0
a 0
few 0
potatoes 0
and 0
a 0
box 0
of 0
rice 0
in 0
the 0
filthy 0
trailer,” 0
said 0
Hogrefe. 0

“But 0
what 0
was 0
most 1
surprising, 1
and 1
heartbreaking 1
was 0
when 0
the 0
team 0
located 0
a 0
total 0
of 0
five 1

11 1

it 0

Both 0

were 0
arrested; 0
Morton 0

just 0
like 0
they 0

here's 0
the 0
proof. 0

Look 0
how 0
they 0
doctored 0
the 0

to 0
not 0
show 0
what 0
clearly 0
took 0
place 0
and 0
then 0
lied 1
about 0
it, 0
and 0
I 0
suppose 0
Fox 0
falls 0
right 0
in 0

with 0
that 0

So, 0
Fox 0
joins 0
with 0

the 1
Clown 1

to 0
go 0
after 0
the 0

something 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
prerogative 0
and 0
claim 0
it's 0
about 0
free 0

It's 0
not. 0

reported: 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
– 0
of 0
which 0
Fox 0
News 0
is 0
a 0

– 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
CNN’s 0
decision 0
to 0
take 0
legal 0
action. 0

“We 0
continue 0

reverse 0
course 0
and 0
fully 0
reinstate 0
CNN’s 0

WHCA 0
President 0
Olivier 0
Knox 0
said. 0

“The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0

should 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
business 0
of 0
arbitrarily 0
picking 0

However, 0

– 0
such 0
as 0
Pulitzer 1
Prize 1
winning 1
Watergate 1

– 1
have 1
criticized 1
CNN 1
over 1
the 1
lawsuit. 1

As 0
they 0
should. 0

It's 0
frivolous, 1
but 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
immature 1
children 1
over 0
at 0

it's 0
not 0
surprising, 0
and 0
frankly, 0
it's 0
no 0
surprise 0
coming 0
from 0
Fox 0
either. 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
called 0
the 0
CNN 0
lawsuit 0
"grandstanding." 0

I 0
wonder 0
what 0
she 0
will 0
call 0
the 0
amicus 0
brief 0
from 0
Fox. 0

"This 0
is 0
just 0
more 0
grandstanding 0
from 0
CNN, 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
vigorously 0
defend 0
against 0
this 0
lawsuit,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“CNN, 0
who 0
has 0
nearly 0
50 0
additional 0
hard 0
pass 0
holders, 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
is 0
no 0
more 0

less 0

than 0
any 0
other 0
media 0
outlet 0
or 0
reporter 0
with 0
respect 0
to 0
the 0
First 0

After 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
asked 0
the 0
President 0
two 0
questions 0
each 0
of 0
which 0
the 0
President 0
answered 0
he 0
physically 0
refused 0
to 0
surrender 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
microphone 0
to 0
an 0
intern, 0
so 0
that 0
other 0

might 0
ask 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
this 0
reporter 0
has 0
inappropriately 0
refused 0
to 0
yield 0
to 0
other 0

Of 0
course, 0
CNN 0
was 0
thrilled 0
as 0
Fox 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
helped 0
them 0
grow 0
a 0
little 0
in 0

to 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
presidential 0
campaign 0
statement 0
that 0
he 0
intended 0
to 0

Trump 0
recognized 0
that 0
the 0
extreme 0
Russiaphobia, 0
which 0
the 1
hegemonic 1
neoconservatives 1
had 1
whipped 1
up 1
since 0
Vladimir 0
Putin’s 0
statement 0
at 0
the 0
Munich 0
Security 0

in 0
2007 0
that 0
Russia 0
was 0
a 0

country 0
and 0
intended 0
to 0
act 0
like 0
one, 0
was 1
a 1
threat 1

The 0
neoconservatives, 0
who 0
have 0
controlled 0
US 0
foreign 0
policy 0
since 0
the 0
Clinton 0

are 0
unwilling 0
to 0
accept 0
limitations 0
by 0
any 0
other 0
country 0
on 0
Washington’s 0
ability 0
to 0

When 0
Putin 0
blocked 0
the 0
Obama 0
regime’s 0
invasion 0
of 0
Syria 0
and 0
bombing 0
of 0
Iran, 0
the 0
neoconservatives 0
paid 0

using 0
NGOs 0

Ukranian 0
politicians 0
financed 0
by 0
Washington 0
to 0
overthrow 0
the 1
democratically 1

of 1
Ukraine 1
and 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
office 0
a 0
government 0
hostile 0
to 0
Russia. 0

The 0
intent 0
was 0
to 0
use 0
Ukraine, 0
a 0
Russian 0
province 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
centuries, 0
to 0
create 0
problems 0
for 0
Russia 0
that 0

also 0
to 0
evict 0

When 1

Washington 1
misrepresented 1

Such 1
an 1

destroyed 1

than 0
restoring 0
a 0
cooperative 0
and 0
mutually 0
respectful 0
relationship 0
between 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
Russia. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
sees 0
it 0
differently. 0

After 0
70 0
years 0
of 0
entrenchment 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
an 0
independent 0
political 0
force. 0

President 0
Eisenhower 0
warned 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
about 0
this 0
likely 0
outcome 0
in 0
1961 0
to 0
no 0
avail. 0

From 0
the 0
standpoint 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex, 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
normalizing 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
downgrades 0
the 0
“Russian 0
threat” 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
essential 0
to 0
the 0
$1,000 0
billion 0
annual 0
budget 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
and 0
the 0
power 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
massive 1
budget 1
conveys. 0

Only 0
16 0
countries 0

out 0
of 0
195 0

have 0
a 0
GDP 0
greater 0
than 0
$1,000 0

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
G 0

to 0

its 0

Obama’s 0

between 0
Donald 0

of 0
the 0

to 0
construct 0
by 0
whatever 0
means 0
possible 0
a 0
case 0
against 0
President 0
Trump. 0

After 0
two 0
years 0
the 0
only 0
evidence 0
we 0
have 0
of 0
Russiagate 0
is 0
that 0
it 1
is 1
a 1
conspiracy 1
against 1
President 1
Trump 1
and 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

Indeed, 0
Mueller, 0
fully 0
aware 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
Trump 0
Putin 0
conspiracy, 0
has 0
not 0
bothered 0
to 0
look 0
for 0
any 0
evidence 0
as 0
there 0
can 0
be 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
something 0
that 0
did 0
not 0
happen. 0

He 0
pulled 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
hat 0
some 0
phony 0
and 0
meaningless 0
indictments 0
of 0
some 0
Russians 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
look 0
like 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
without 0
having 0
to 0
prove 0
it, 0
but 0
his 0
main 0
focus 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
framing 0
Paul 0
Manafort. 0

Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
of 0
Manafort 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
story 0
line. 0

Manafort’s 0
alleged 0
crimes 0
are 0
far 0
outside 0
Mueller’s 0
mandate 0
and 0
took 0
place, 0
if 0
they 0
did, 0
years 0
before 0
the 0
alleged 0
events 0
of 0
Russiagate. 0

Manafort’s 0
conviction 0
by 0
a 0
jury 0
on 0
8 0
of 0
the 0
18 0
counts 0
is 0
being 0
misrepresented 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0
hating 0
presstitutes 0
as 0
vindication 0
of 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation 0
and 0
as 0
“A 0
dark 0
day 0
for 0
Trump,” 0
with 0
the 0
presstitutes 0
suggesting 0
a 0
Watergate 0
parallel 0
that 0
will 0
force 0
Trump 0
from 0
office. 0

Manafort 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
not 0
of 0
Russiagate, 0
but 0
of 0
income 0
tax 0
evasion 0
and 0
misrepresenting 0
his 0
financial 0
position 0
on 0
a 0
loan 0
application. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
if 0
Manafort 0
is 0
guilty 0
or 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
Mueller’s 0
frameup 0
and 0
an 1
incompetent 1
jury. 1

American 0
juries 0
are 0
notoriously 0
incompetent, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
97% 0
of 0
felony 0
indictments 0
are 0
settled 0
with 0
a 0
plea 0
bargain. 0

Even 0
the 0
innocent 0
had 0
rather 0
work 0
out 0
a 0
plea 0
arrangement 0
and 0
admit 0
to 0
something 0
that 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
than 0
to 0
face 0
an 1
insouciant 1
American 1
jury. 1

Remember 0
the 0
jury 0
that 0
condemned 0
the 0
survivors 0
of 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
massacre 0
of 0
the 0
Branch 0
Davidians 0
in 0
Waco, 0
Texas, 0
to 0
be 0
locked 0
away 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
not 0
talk 0
and 0
tell 0
of 0
the 0
mass 0
murder 0
inflicted 0
on 0
a 0
religious 0
group 0
by 0
the 0
FBI. 0

It 0
is 0
unclear 0
how 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
it 0
can 0
be 0
to 0
misrepresent 0
your 0
financial 0
position 0
on 0
a 0
loan 0
application 0
when 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
causes 0
of 0
the 0
mortgage 0
backed 0
derivative 0
crisis 0
was 0
the 0
misrepresentation 0
of 0
mortgage 0
applicants 0
on 0
the 0
loan 0
documents 0
by 0
the 0
companies 0
issuing 0
the 0
mortgages. 0

Instead 0
of 0
prosecution, 0
Washington 0
relied 0
on 0
the 0
Federal 0
Reserve 0
to 0
bail 0
out 0
the 0
banks 0
holding 0
the 0
misrepresented 0
loans. 0

Income 0
tax 0
invasion 0
is 0
the 0
purview 0
of 0
the 0
IRS, 0
not 0
of 0
a 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
who 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
looking 0
for 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
Trump 0

conspiracy. 0

So, 1
why 1
did 1
Mueller 1
focus 1
on 1
Manafort? 1

Let 1
Harvard 1
Law 1
Professor 1
Alan 1
Dershowitz 1
tell 1
you: 1

“All 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
needs, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
charge 0
a 0
subject 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
with 0
lying 0
to 0
a 0
prosecutor, 0
is 0
a 0
single 0
witnesses 0
willing 0
to 0
contradict 0
the 0
subject. 0

“The 1
witness 1
may 1
not 1
only 1
be 1
“singing,” 1
he 1
may 1
also 1
be 1
“composing” 1
that 0
is, 0
making 0
up 0
or 0
embellishing 0
a 0
story 0
because 0
he 0
knows 0
that 0
the 0
better 0
his 0
story, 0
the 0
better 0
the 0
deal. 0

“Under 0
federal 0
law, 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
such 0
a 0
“flipped 1
witness” 1
need 0
not 0
be 0
corroborated 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
a 0
conviction. 0

“Even 0
one 0
question 0
that 0
results 0
in 0
an 0
answer 0
that 0
is 0
contradicted 0
by 0
one 0
witness 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
spring 1
the 1
perjury 1
trap.” 1

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
made 0
various 0
statements 0
disputing 0
the 0
orchestrated 0
Russiagate 0
accusations 0
that, 0
if 0
Manafort 0
as 0
witness 0
for 0
the 0
Special 0
Prosecutor 0
contradicted, 0
could 0
send 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
to 0
prison 0
for 0
perjury. 0

Knowing 0
this, 0
Mueller, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion 0
a 0
proven 0
corrupt 0
person, 0
decided 0
to 1
put 1
the 1
squeeze 1
on 0
Manafort 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
force 0
Manafort 0
to 0
save 0
himself 0
by 0
giving 0
false 0
testimony 0
against 0
Trump. 0

This 0
tactic 0
is 0
used 0
every 0
day 0
by 0
state, 0
local, 0
and 0
federal 0
prosecutors. 0

Americans 0
who 0
believe 0
the 0
indictments 0
and 0
convictions 0
are 0
unaware 0
that 0
97% 0
of 0
the 0
time 0
the 0
convictions 0
rest 0
on 0
self 0
incrimination 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
worse 0
punishment. 0

In 0
Manafort’s 0
case 0
it 0
didn’t, 0
or 0
hasn’t, 0
worked. 0

Yet. 0

Manafort 0
is 0
due 0
for 0
a 0
second 0
trial, 0
this 0
time 0
for 0
allegely 0
acting 0
as 0
an 0
unregistered 0
foreign 0
agent 0
for 0
Ukrainian 0
interests 0
and 0
for 0
making 0
false 0
statements 0
not 0
under 0
oath 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
government. 0

Reportedly, 0
Manafort 0
is 0
being 0
held 0
in 0
solitary 0
confinement, 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
torture 0
designed 0
to 0
break 0
a 0
person’s 0
spirit. 0

Like 0
Manafort’s 0
first 0
trial, 0
his 0
second 0
trial 0
has 0
nothing 0
whatsoever 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Russiagate, 0
but 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
learn 0
that 0
from 0
the 0
presstitute 0
media 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Manafort 0
can 0
still 0
be 0
coerced 0
to 0
say 0
something 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drive 0
Trump 0
from 0
office. 0

What 0
about 0
Michael 0
Cohen, 0
a 0
former 0
attorney 0
for 0
Trump? 0

Mueller 0
saw 0
no 0
value 0
in 0
the 0
Cohen 0
case 0
and 0
passed 0
it 0
off 0
to 0
a 0
regular 0
US 0
attorney 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

Therefore, 0
it 0
would 0
appear 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation. 0

Cohen 0
avoided 0
a 0
jury 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
guilty 0
of 0
five 0
counts 0
of 0
personal 0
income 0
tax 0
evasion, 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
making 0
a 0
false 0
statement 0
to 0
a 0
financial 0
institution 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
loan, 0
and 0
two 0
counts 0
related 0
to 0
illegal 0
campaign 0
contributions. 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
campagin 0
contributions, 0
he 0
contradicted 0
his 0
previous 0
statements. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
on 0
Trump’s 0
instruction, 0
he 0
paid 0
off 0
two 0
women 0
who 0
were 0
claiming 0
sexual 0
affairs 0
with 0
Trump. 0

The 1
intricacies 1
of 1
American 1
laws 1
relating 1
to 1
politics 1
are 1
often 1
unclear. 1

Apparently, 0
the 0
charge 0
is 0
that 0
Cohen 0
used 0
monies 0
raised 0
for 0
a 0
political 0
campaign 0
to 0
pay 0
off 0
two 0
women, 0
who 0
saw 0
and 0
capitalized 0
on 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
extort 0
Trump 0
for 0
money, 0
and 0
this 0
was 0
an 0
illegal 0
use 0
of 0
the 0
money. 0

Why 1
a 1
lawyer 1
would 1
pay 1
off 1
women, 1
whose 1
stories 1
might 1
or 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
true, 1
in 1
an 1
illegal 1
way 1
when 1
his 1
client 1
is 1
a 1
multi 1
billionaire 1
doesn’t 1
make 1
much 1
sense. 1

But 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
questions 1
that 1
the 1
presstitutes 1
are 1
interested 1
in. 1

Nevertheless, 0
Cohen’s 0
plea 0
is 0
associated 0
with 0
a 0
case 0
brought 0
by 0
another 0
prosecutor, 0
not 0
by 0
Special 0
Prosecutor 0
Mueller. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
sufficiently 0
familiar 0
with 0
US 0
legal 0
procedures 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
say 0
how 0
this 0
gets 0
brought 0
back 0
into 0
Mueller’s 0
investigation. 0

The 0
facts 0
are 0
this: 0

The 0
US 0
military/security 0
complex 0
will 0
not 0
permit 0
any 0
normalization 0
of 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Period. 0

At 0
some 0
point 0
Putin 0
and 0
Lavrov 0
and 0
the 0
idiot 0
Russian 0
Atlanticist 0
Integrationists 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
this 0
fact, 0
or 0
Russia 0
will 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

Trump, 0
by 0
declaring 0
normalization 0
of 0
relations 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
his 0
two 0
principal 0
goals 0
for 0
his 0
presidency, 0
earned 0
the 0
emnity 0
of 0
the 0
powerful 0
military/security 0
complex. 0

By 0
defeating 0
Hillary 0
for 0
the 0
presidency, 0
Trump 0
inflamed 1
the 1
US 1
media’s 1
hatred, 1
committed 0
as 0
the 0
presstitutes 0
are 0
to 0
Identity 0
Politics 0
and 0
hatred 0
of 0
the 1
“white 1
male 1
oppressors” 1
who 1
elected 1
Trump. 1

Trump 0
will 0
never 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
preventing 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
female 0

an 0

crime 0
by 0
a 0
misogynist 0
white 0

who 0
“grabs 0
women 0

The 0

that 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
during 0
the 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
Trump 0
has 0
no 0
idea 0
of 0
Washington 0
and 0
no 0
idea 0
who 0
to 0
appoint 0
who 0
would 0
support 0
him 0
rather 0
than 0
work 0
against 0
him. 0

Consequently, 0
he 0
has 0
a 0
government 0
working 0
against 0
him. 0

This 0

of 0

from 0

What 0
Israel 0
is 0
doing 0
by 0
attempting 0
to 0
use 0
US 0
military 0
force 0
against 0
Iran 0
is 0
unifying 0
a 0
new 0
alliance 0
that 0
is 0
too 0
powerful 0
for 0

Washington/Israeli 0
alliance. 0

Russia, 0
China, 0
Syria, 0

and 0
Pakistan 0
are 0
the 0
locations 0
of 0
populations 0
that 1
massively 1
outnumber 1
Washington’s 1

Each 0
of 0
these 0
countries 0
are 0
being 0
united 0
by 0
Washington’s 0
stupid 0
and 0
inexplicable 0
actions 0
against 0
each. 0

Militarily, 0
Israel 0
is 0
of 0
no 0
consequence. 0

Twice 0
the 0
vaunted 0
Israeli 0
Army, 0
capable 0
of 0
nothing 0
but 0
murdering 0
unarmed 0
women 0
and 0

were 0
defeated 0
and 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
southern 0
Lebanon 0
by 0
a 0
few 0
thousand 0
Hezbollah 0
militia. 0

Israel 0
is 0
too 0
cowardly 0
to 0
try 0
it 0
a 0
third 0
time, 0
and 0
is 0
relying 0
on 0
the 0
stupid 0
Americans 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
job 0
for 0
them. 0

The 1
entire 1
world 1
looks 1
at 1
America 1
and 1
Israel, 1
and 0
what 0
does 0
the 0
world 0
see? 0

Two 0
countries, 0
both 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
exterminating 0
the 0
native 0
populations, 0
distrusted 0
and 0
universally 0
hated, 0
both 0
of 0
which 0
survive 0
by 0
purhasing 0
the 0
governments 0
of 0
other 0
countries 0
and 0
by 0
endless 0
lies 0
that 0
describe 0
everyone 0
but 0
themselves 0
and 0
their 0
vassals 0
as 0
evil 0
criminals 0
that 0
must 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

For 0
example, 0
the 0
Gaza 0
Strip, 0
the 0
largest 0
concentration 0
camp 0
ever 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
is 0
being 0
systematically 0
destroyed 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
life 0
within 0
it 0
by 0
Israel 0
under 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
obvious 1
and 1
transparanent 1
lie 1
that 0
all 0
within 0
Gaza 0
are 0
terrorists 0
outfitted 0
with 0
bomb 0
belts 0
who 0
are 0
committed 0
to 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0

Not 0
only 0

of 0
fighting 0
age, 0
but 0
also 0
old 0
men, 0
pregnant 0
women, 0
children, 0
all 0
Palestinians 0
are 0
being 0
murdered 0
by 0
the 0
Israeli 0
military. 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
agrees 0
with 0
Israel 0
that 0
all 0
Palestinians 0
must 0
be 0
destroyed, 0
the 1
sooner 1
the 1
better. 1

The 0
Chinese 0
are 0
busy 0
taking 0
advantage 0
of 0
the 0
financial 0
opportunities 0
that 0
the 1
idiot 1
Americans 1
forfeit, 0
but 0
otherwise 0
do 0
not 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
any 0
strategic 0
sense 0
of 0
how 0
to 0
proceed 0
in 0
the 0
drama 0
unfolding 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
their 0
eyes. 0

For 0
China, 0
money 0
is 0
now 0
all. 0

The 0
Russians 0
are 0
infected 0
with 0
the 0
American 0
propaganda 0
infused 1
into 1
their 1
veins 1
during 0
the 0
Yeltsin 0
era 0
when 0
Russia 0
was 0
an 0
American 0
puppet 0
state. 0

Slowly, 0
if 0
not 0
surely, 0
the 0
Russians 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
their 0
senses 0
and 0
realizing 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
American 0
“partner.” 0

If 1
Trump 1
is 1
defeated 1
and 1
moved 1
off 1
the 1
table, 1
what 1
happens 1
when 1
Russia 1
and 1
China 1
finally 1
realize 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
conciliation 1
with 1
Washington? 1

When 1
all 1
the 1
false 1
hopes 1
and 1
bets 1
of 1
the 1
Russian 1
and 1
Chinese 1
governments 1
of 1
conciliation 1
on 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
mutual 1
economic 1
interests 1
come 1
to 1
naught, 1
what 1
happens? 1

It 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
life 1
on 1
earth. 1

The 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation” 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
timed 0
to 0
influence 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections 0
with 0
unsubstantiated 0
accusations 0
made 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
elections 0
in 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
produce 0
a 0
Democratic 0
Congress 0
that 0
would 0
impeach 0
President 0
Trump 0
on 0
false 0
charges. 0

The 0
presstitutes 0
would 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
frameup. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
the 0
real 0
election 0
meddling 0
is 0
being 0
done 0
by 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation.” 0
See 0
here 0
and 0
here. 0

Such 1
an 1
impeachment 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
coup. 1

The 1
consequence 1
would 1
be 1
deep 1
and 1
permanent 1
divisions 1
in 1
American 1
political 1
life 1
and 1
more 1
rabid 1
Russiaphobia 1
that 1
would 1
result 1
in 1
war. 1

The 0
danger 0
is 0
real 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation” 0
aided 0
and 0
abetted 0
by 0
the 0
presstitute 0
media 0

The 1
very 1
word 1
“secrecy” 0
is 0
repugnant 1
in 0
a 0
free 0
and 0
open 0
society; 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
as 0
a 0
people 0
inherently 0
and 0
historically 0
opposed 0
to 0
secret 0
societies, 0
to 0
secret 0
oaths 0
and 0
to 0
secret 0
proceedings. 0

We 0
decided 0
long 0

that 0
the 0
dangers 1
of 0
excessive 1
and 1
unwarranted 1
concealment 1
of 0
pertinent 0
facts 0
far 0
outweighed 0
the 0
dangers 0
which 0
are 0
cited 0
to 0
justify 0
it. 0

Even 0
today, 0
there 0
is 0
little 0
value 0
in 0
opposing 0
the 0
threat 0
of 0
a 0
closed 0
society 0
by 0
imitating 0
its 0
arbitrary 0
restrictions. 0

Even 1
today, 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
value 1
in 1
insuring 0
the 0
survival 0
of 0
our 1
nation 1
if 0
our 1
traditions 1
do 0
not 0
survive 0
with 0
it. 0

And 1
there 1
is 1
very 1
grave 1
danger 1
that 1
an 1
announced 1
need 1
for 1
increased 1
security 1
will 1
be 1
seized 1
upon 1
by 0
those 0
anxious 0
to 0
expand 0
its 0

the 0
very 0
limits 0
of 0

Working 0
directly 0
in 0

and 0
behind 0
the 0

I 0
can 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
have 0
been 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
censorship 0
initiative 0
for 0
a 0
long 0

it 0
started 0
approximately 0
three 0

awareness. 0

One 0
thing 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
remember 0
here 0
is, 0
this 0
isn’t 0
about 0
democrats 0
vs 0
republicans, 0
it’s 0
about 0
the 0
elite 1
preserving 0
their 0
control, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
moment, 0
they 0
are 0
using 0
the 0
DNC 0
as 0
the 0
mouthpiece 0
for 0
that. 0

Thus, 0
anything 0
that 0
slandered 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
during 0
the 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
for 0

was 0
labelled 0
as 0
fake 0
news, 0
even 0
if 0
evidence 0
and 0
credible 0

were 0
used. 0

This 0
is 0
because 0

that 0

Well 0
at 0
the 0
moment 0
it 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
censoring 0
of 0
information. 0

Their 0
key 0
strategy 0
is 0
to 0
label 0
everything 0

to 0
build 0

This 0
is 0
something 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
outside 0
can’t 0
really 0
see 0
as 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
happens, 0
but 0
I 0
am 0
on 0
the 0
inside, 0
so 0
I 0
see 0
exactly 0
what’s 0
taking 0
place. 0

Eyes 0
were 0
shifting 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
small 0
group 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
controlled 0
media 0
since 0
media’s 0
inception. 0

Independent 0
media 0
brought 0
to 0
light 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
facts 0
that 0
threaten 0
the 0
agenda 0
of 0
the 0
global 1
elite, 1
like 0
intelligence 0
agency/government 0
connections 0
to 0
mainstream 0
media 0
for 0
example, 0
and 0
their 0
plans 0
in 0
the 0
middle 0
east 0
to 0
basically 0
invade, 0
take 0
over, 0
and 0
establish 0
a 0
government 0
that 0
suits 0
the 0
Deep 0
State’s 0
best 0
interests. 0

There 0
are 0
several 0
examples 0
from 0
all 0
fields 0
that 0
surround 0
human 0
life, 0
from 0
healthcare 0
to 0
politics, 0
and 0
it 0
all 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
controlled 0
by 0
one 0
massive 0
conglomerate 0
at 0
the 0
top. 0

We’ve 0
been 0
writing 0
about 0
this 0
for 0
nearly 0
a 0
decade 0
now. 0

The 0
Deep 0
State 0
Has 0
Power 0
Due 0
To 0
Our 0
Unconsciousness 0

They 0
(global 1
elite) 1
continue 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
able 0
to 0
do 0
because 0
of 0
human 0
consciousness. 0

The 0
more 0
people 0
who 0
consider 0
this 0
a 0
“conspiracy 0
theory” 0
and 0
turn 0
their 0
heads 0
away, 0
the 0
easier 0
it 0
is 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
continue 0
and 0
have 0
power. 0

I 0
don’t 0
understand 0
how 0
so 0
much 0
information 0
can 0
come 0
to 0
light, 0
yet 0
when 0
it’s 0
deemed 0
a 0
“conspiracy” 0
theory” 0
within 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
everybody 0
simply 0
follows 0
the 0
rhetoric, 0
without 0
doing 0
any 0
investigation 0
or 0
research 0
for 0
themselves. 0

If 0
you 0
don’t 0
look 0
into 0
it, 0
don’t 0
share 0
an 0
opinion 0
on 0
it. 0

“Condemnation 0
without 0
investigation 0
is 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
ignorance.” 0
– 0
Einstein. 0

All 0
of 0
these 0
media 0
sources 0
were 0
operating 0
normally 0
until 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
became 0
president, 0
and 0
until 0
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
Obama, 0
Bush, 0
etc 0
were 0
outed 0
as 0
global 1
elite 1
puppets. 1

Heck, 0
the 0
Clinton’s 0
and 0
John 0
Podesta 0
have 0
even 0
referenced 0
Wikileaks 0
before 0
that 0
became 0
‘fake.’ 0
Despite 0
operating 0
with 0
credibility 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
decade 0
before 0
the 0
accusations. 0

What 0
does 0
the 0
media 0
operating 0
normally 0
mean? 0

Still 0
manipulating 0
the 0
public, 0
but 0
at 0
least 0
they 0
were 0
reporting 0
on 0
both 0
sides 0
as 0
a 0
whole. 0

Now, 0
it’s 0
quite 0
different. 0

Donald 0
Trump 0
is 0
extremely 1
vilified 1
not 0
because 0
he 0
allegedly 0
is/was 0
racist/sexist, 0
but 0
because 1
he 1
threatens 1
neoliberalism 1
and 1
neoconservatism, 1
the 1
American 1
empire, 1
one 0
that 0
continues 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
push 0
an 0
Orwellian 0
state 0
type 0
of 0
existence, 0
which 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
ramping 0
up 0
every 0
single 0
year. 0

Trump 0
was 0
not 0
supposed 0
to 0
win, 0
and 0
no 1
this 1
isn’t 1
about 1
democrats 1
vs 1
republicans 1
or 0
that 0
Trump 0
is 0
a 1
saviour. 1

The 0
Deep 0
State 0
responded 0
like 0
they 0
always 0
do 0
every 0
time 0
something 0
‘goes 0
wrong,’ 0
they 0
blamed 0
Russia, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
media 0
outlets 0
like 0
Collective 0
Evolution 0
and 0
others. 0

are 0

pretty 1
ridiculous, 1
but 0
they’re 0

Even 0
if 0
they 0
do 0
succeed 0
in 0
deleting 0
more 0
independent 0
media 0
sites 0
from 0
social 0
media, 0
they 0
cannot 0
erase 0
them 0
from 0
the 0
internet. 0

Yes, 0
social 0
media 0
platforms 0
were 0
great 0
for 0
spreading 0
information 0
across 0
the 0
internet 0
and 0
for 0
having 0
more 0
people 0
become 0
aware 0
of 0
it. 0

It 0
really 0
showed 0
what 0
people 0
were 0
interested 0
in, 0
and 0
what 0
people 0
wanted 0
to 0
see, 0
but 0
clearly, 0
we 1
do 1
not 1
live 1
in 1
a 1
democracy 1
and 0
that 0
doesn’t 0
matter. 0

the 0

that 0
what 0

More 0
and 0
more 0
people 0
see 0
it 0
this 0
way 0
because 0
our 0
consciousness 0
continues 0
to 0
shift. 0

have 0
been 0
a 0

to 0

it, 0

it’s 0
something 0
that 0

The 0

we 0

truly 0

past 0
the 0

the 0
more 0
we 0
pull 0

from 0
the 0
power 0
grid 0
that 0
keeps 0
all 0
this 0
in 0
place. 0

2020 0

Now, 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
taking 0
place 0
with 0
perfect 0
timing 0
before 0
the 0
2020 0
election. 0

No 0
doubt 0
that 0
the 0
Deep 0
State 0
will 0
want 0
to 0
take 0
back 0
the 0
presidency, 0
but 0
ultimately, 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
bigger 0
picture 0
here. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
politics 0
actually 0
is, 0
and 0
the 0
past 0
few 0
years 0
alone 0
have 0
provided 0
us 0
with 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
see. 0

It’s 0
nothing 0
but 0
elite 1
people, 0
corporations 0
and 0
the 0
financial 0
elite 1
that 0
have 0
become 0
drenched 0
with 0
so 0
much 0
power 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
direct 0
human 0
will 0
and 0
use 0
it 0
for 0
their 0
own 0
selfish 0
purposes. 0

With 0
powerful 1
revelations 0
that 0
have 0
come 0
to 0
light, 0
like 0
elite 1
pedophilia 1
and 0
ritual 1
abuse, 1
and 0
extreme 1
corruption, 0
why 0
do 0
we 0
still 0
participate? 0

Why 0
do 0
we 0
choose 0
to 0
elect 0
these 0
people? 0

Why 0
do 0
we 0
believe 0
we 0
live 0
in 0
a 0
democracy 0
when 0
what 0
people 0
want 0
to 0
look 0
at, 0
and 0
what 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
people 0
want 0
to 0
have 0
done 0
(like 0
GMO 0
labelling), 0
is 0
completely 0
censored? 0

Why 0
are 0
harmful 1
‘things’ 0
surrounding 0
us 0
constantly 0
when 0
we 0
have 0
science 0
showing 0
it’s 0
not 0
safe, 0
like 0
cell 0

etc. 0

It’s 0
simply 0
because 0
power 0
lies 0
within 0
the 0
corporatocracy. 0

Decisions 0
aren’t 0
being 0
made 0
with 0
the 0

and 0
this 0
is 0
why 0
the 0

failing 0
because 0
it’s 0
not 0

anything 0

the 0

The 0
fact 0
of 0
the 0
matter 0
is: 0

“The 0
conscious 0
and 0
intelligent 0
manipulation 0
of 0
the 0
organized 0
habits 0
and 0
opinions 0
of 0
the 0
masses 0
is 0
an 0
important 0
element 0
in 0

Those 0
who 0
manipulate 0
this 0

an 0
invisible 0

The 0
Takeaway 0

Recognize 0
what’s 0
happening, 0
the 0
massive 0
censorship 0
of 0
information, 0
coupled 0
with 0
the 0
ridicule 0
or 0
finger 0
pointing, 0
or 0
even 0
arrest 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
choose 0
to 0
voice 0
an 0
opinion 0
in 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
rhetoric 0
that’s 0
constantly 0
spewed 1
by 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
which 0
in 0
turn 0
is 0
usually 0
believed 0
by 0
the 0
masses. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
independent 0
media 0
represents 0
a 0
shift 0
in 0
consciousness. 0

A 0
shift 0
in 0
our 0
perceptions, 0
thoughts, 0
feelings 0
and 0
general 0
self 0
awareness 0
about 0
our 0
own 0
planet 0
is 0
changing, 0
and 0
thus, 0
change 0
has 0
been 0
sprouted 0
in 0
multiple 0
different 0
areas, 0
including 0
political 0
corruption 0
and 0
the 0
stranglehold 0
it 0
has 0
over 0
our 0
world. 0

We 0
are 0
more 0
aware, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
still 0
some 0
ways 0
to 0
go… 0

A 0
good 0
chunk 0
of 0
work 0
has 0
been 0
done. 0

A 0
massive 1
transformation 0
of 0
consciousness 0
has 0
taken 0
place 0
and 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
a 0
global 0
mass 0
is 0
growing 0
closer 0
to 0
a 0
critical 0
mass. 0

The 0
censorship 0
of 0
independent 0
media 0
is 0
irrelevant 0
in 0
a 0
sense, 0
because 0
the 0
shift 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
happen, 0
change 0
will 1
continue 1
to 1
happen, 1
and 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
deep 0
state 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
the 0
public 0
to 0
become 0
aware 0
of 0
will 0
keep 0
making 0
its 0
way 0
into 0
transparency. 0

Independent 0
media 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
share 0
information 0
because 1
of 1
a 1
lack 1
of 1
credible 1
information 1
and 1
plain 1
truth 1
within 1
the 1
mainstream. 1

People 0
are 0
hungry 0
for 0
it, 0
and 0
will 0
seek 0
it 0
out 0
themselves. 0

Jim 0
Acosta, 0
you're 0
lying. 1

New 0

you're 0
lying. 1

Every 0
media 0
outlet 0
from 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
to 0
NBC, 0
you're 0
lying 1
when 0
you 0
say 0
the 0
video 0
was 0
doctored 0
and 0
that 0
Acosta 0
didn't 0
touch 0
the 0
woman. 0

At 0
least 0
C 0
SPAN 0
is 0
neutral 0
in 0
the 0
matter 0
and 0
simply 0
let 0
the 0
video 0
reprove 0
every 0
single 0
one 0
of 0
them. 0

But 0
it's 0
more 0
than 0
that, 0
self 1
proclaimed 1
"fact 1
checkers" 1
like 0
Snopes 0
simply 0
posted 0
an 0
Associated 0
Press 0
article, 0
which 0
clearly 0
biased 0
towards 0
indicating 0
the 0
video 0
was 0
"doctored" 0
by 0
saying 0
it 0
was 0
sped 0
up, 0
but 0
that's 0
not 0
doctoring. 0

Doctoring 0
is 0
when 0
you 0
manipulate 0
the 0
content 0
to 0
misconstrue 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
what 0
took 0
place. 0

If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
doctoring, 1
go 1
to 1
0:58 1
of 1
the 1
video 1
above, 1
and 1
don't 1
be 1
drinking 1
anything 1
when 1
you 1
do 1
because 1
it's 1
hilarious. 1

But 0
it 0
isn't 0
just 0
Snopes 0
or 0

like 0
that. 0

Take, 0
for 0

websites 0
like 0

I 0

libel 0
and 0
they 0
didn't 0
just 0
correct 0
it, 0
they 0
removed 0
it 0
entirely 0
because 0
they 0
knew 0
I 0
was 0
two 0
days 0
away 0
from 0
filing 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
them. 0

MBFC 0
actually 0
called 0
CNN 0
"left 1

which 0
is 0
correct 0
but 0
followed 0
up 0
with: 0

Overall, 0
we 0
rate 0
CNN 0
left 0
biased 0
based 0
on 0

that 0
often 0

the 0

due 0
to 0
misinformation 0

failed 0
fact 0

from 0

This 0

at 0

what 0
I 0
was 0
told 0

that 0
is 0
simply 0
to 0

Instead, 0
they 0
not 0

sure 0
NewsGuard, 0
Yemile 0
Bucay, 0
Anna 0
Sophie 0
Harling 0

Amy 0

obvious 0

outright 1
lies 1

propaganda 1
by 0
the 0
Clown 1
News 1
Network, 1
but 0
you 0
can't 0
expect 0
real 0
transparency 0
from 0
an 0
outlet 0
like 0
Newsguard 0
whose 0
writers 0
aren't 0
transparent 0
about 0
their 0
own 0
political 0
bias, 0
can 0
you? 0

Nope, 0
you 1
can't, 1
and 0
you 1
can't 1
expect 0
it 0
when 0
some 0
of 0
those 0
writers 0
write 0
for 0
other 0
publications 0
that 0
don't 0
measure 0
up 0
to 0
NewsGuard's 0
standards 0
either. 0

The 0
reason 0
this 0
little 0
incident 0
shouldn't 0
be 0
let 0
go 0
of 0
so 0
soon 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
clearest 0
demonstrations 0
of 0
the 0
media's 0
bias, 0
which 0
we 0
all 0
have, 0
lies 1
and 0
propaganda. 1

It 0
should 0
be 0
used 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
in 0
article 0
after 0
article 0
to 0
remind 0
people 0
about 0
the 0
total 1
dishonesty 1
and 0
complete 1
disregard 1
for 0
reporting 0
the 0
facts 0
by 0

such 0
as 0
CNN 0
and 0
to 0
not 0
blindly 0
trust 0
self 1
proclaimed 1
fact 1
checkers 1
who 0
will 0
not 0
tell 0
you 0
the 0
truth 0
either. 0

CNN 0
has 0
lost 1
its 1
mind 1
to 0
the 0
point 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
suing 0
over 0
Acosta 0
losing 0
his 0
press 0
pass. 0

He 1
was 1
their 1
inside 1
boy, 1
after 0
all. 0

But 0
the 0
real 0
irony 0
here 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
media 0
labeled 0
Paul 0
Joseph 0
Watson 0
and 0
Infowars 0
as 0
"conspiracy 1
theorists" 1
and 0
yet, 0
PJW 0

to 0
smear 0
President 0
Trump, 0
Sarah 0

What's 0
amazing 0
is 0
that 0
Democrats 0
cover 0
for 0
their 0
own, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
obvious 1
hypocrisy 1
they 0
demonstrate 0
when 0
they 0
opponents 0
are 0
accused 0
of 0
such 0
things. 0

Even 0
one 0
woman 0
in 0
the 0
Loomer 0
video 0
says, 0
why 0
are 0
they 0
waiting 0
till 0
now 0
to 0
bring 0
this 0
forward? 0

Well, 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Monahan, 0
perhaps 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
asked, 0
but 0
not 0
for 0
Amy 0
Alexander. 0

That 0
report 0
was 0
filed 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
decade 0
ago. 0

It 0
appears 0
that 0
with 0
Ms. 0
Monahan's 0
claims 0
and 0
Keith 0
Ellison's 0
unwillingness 0
to 0
address 0
the 0
public 0
with 0
his 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
that 0
perhaps, 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
changed 0
his 0
ways 0
at 0
all. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
can 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
justify 0
his 0
actions 0
based 0
upon 0
the 0
demonic 1
teachings 1
of 1
Muhammad 1
in 1
the 1
Koran. 1

He 0
has 0
already 0
won 0
the 0
primary 0
to 0
be 0
Minnesota's 0
AG. 0

Will 1
the 1
people 1
not 1
demand 1
justice 1
and 1
vote 1
a 1
Communist 1
backed, 1
Muslim, 1
accused 1
woman 1

into 0

There 0
is 0
abundant 0
evidence 0
that 0

is 0
telling 0

she 0

that 0

By 0

there 0
is 0
absolutely 0
no 0

whatsoever 0
that 0

not 0
rule 0
on 0

that 0
the 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
pass 0
violated 0
his 0
rights 0
under 0

he 0

did 0
not 0
provide 0
Acosta 0
with 0
due 0
process 0
to 0
legally 0
remove 0
his 0
pass. 0

The 0
ruling 0
followed 0
a 0
court 0
hearing 0
held 0
Wednesday 0
in 0
Washington, 0
where 0
lawyers 0
for 0
CNN 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
faced 0
off 0
over 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
press 0
access. 0

CNN 0
had 0
the 0
broad 0
support 0
of 0
other 0
news 0
organizations 0
that 0
believed 0
the 0
White 0
House’s 0
actions 0
posed 0
a 0
challenge 0
to 0
press 0
freedom. 0

“We 0
are 0
gratified 0
with 0
this 0
result 0
and 0
we 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
a 0
full 0
resolution 0
in 0
the 0
coming 0
days,” 0
a 0
CNN 0
representative 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“Our 0
sincere 0
thanks 0
to 0
all 0
who 0
have 0
supported 0
not 0
just 0
CNN, 0
but 0
a 0
free, 1
strong 1
and 1
independent 1
American 1
press.” 1

The 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
it 0
would 0
abide 0
by 0
Kelly’s 0
ruling. 0

“Today, 0
the 0
court 0
made 0
clear 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
absolute 0
right 0
to 0
access 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
court, 0
we 0
will 0
temporarily 0
reinstate 0
the 0
reporter’s 0
hard 0
pass,” 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
secretary 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“We 0
will 0
also 0
further 0
develop 0
rules 0
and 0
processes 0
to 0
ensure 0
fair 0
and 0
orderly 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

There 0
must 0
be 0
decorum 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House.” 0

Acosta’s 0
press 0
credential 0
was 0
revoked 0
by 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
Nov. 0
7 0
after 0
a 0
testy 1
exchange 0
with 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
at 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
news 0
conference. 0

At 0
one 0
point, 0
Acosta 0
refused 0
to 0
relinquish 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
who 0
tried 0
to 0
retrieve 0
it 0
from 0
him. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
latest 0
in 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
public 0
confrontations 0
between 0
Acosta 0
and 0
Trump, 0
who 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
characterized 0
CNN’s 0
critical 0
coverage 0
of 0
him 0
as 0
“fake 1
news” 1
since 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
campaign. 0

CNN’s 0
suit 0
filed 0
Tuesday 0
says 0
the 0
suspension 0
of 0
Acosta’s 0
credential 0
violates 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment’s 0
protection 0
of 0
free 0
speech. 0

It 0
also 0
says 0
the 0
way 0
the 0
administration 0
revoked 0
the 0
pass, 0
with 0
no 0
direct 0
notice 0
to 0
Acosta 0
or 0
a 0
written 0
explanation 0
detailing 0
the 0
decision, 0
violated 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment’s 0
protection 0
of 0
due 0
process 0
and 0
the 0
federal 0
Administrative 0
Procedures 0
Act. 0

“This 0
severe 1
and 0
unprecedented 1
punishment 0
is 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
years 0
of 0
hostility 0
by 0
President 0
Trump 0
against 0
CNN 0
and 0
Acosta 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
contents 0
of 0
their 0
reporting 0
an 0
unabashed 1
attempt 0
to 0
censor 0
the 0
press 0
and 0
exclude 0
reporters 0
from 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
who 0
challenge 0
and 0
dispute 0
the 0
president’s 0
point 0
of 0
view,” 0
the 0
suit 0
says. 0

Responding 0
to 0
the 0
CNN 0
suit, 0
lawyers 0
for 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
had 0
broad 0
discretion 0
to 0
regulate 0
access 0
to 0
journalists 0
and 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
public. 0

“If 0
the 0
president 0
wants 0
to 0
exclude 0
all 0
reporters 0
from 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
grounds, 0
he 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
do 0
that,” 0
Deputy 0
Assistant 0
Attorney 0
General 0
James 0
Burnham 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
hearing. 0

“There’s 0
no 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right.” 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
argued 0
that 0
Acosta’s 0
behavior, 0
which 0
it 0
described 0
as 0
rude 1
and 0
aggressive, 1
was 0
the 0
reason 0
for 0
revoking 0
his 0
credential. 0

Mark 0
Lukasiewicz, 0
dean 0
of 0
The 0
Lawrence 0
Herbert 0
School 0
of 0
Communication 0
at 0
Hofstra 0
University 0
and 0
a 0
former 0
network 0
news 0
executive, 0
praised 0
the 0
judge’s 0
decision, 0
which 0
he 0
said 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
surprise. 0

“The 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
lots 0
of 0
other 0
ways 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
reporters 0
if 0
that’s 0
their 0
concern, 0
but 0
closing 0
the 0
gate 0
to 0
a 0
news 0
organization 0
is 0
not 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
ways, 0
and 0
it’s 0
important 0
that 0
the 0
court 0
stood 0
up 0
and 0
said 0
that,” 0
Lukasiewicz 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
reporter 0
has 0
behaved 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
a 0
president 0
doesn’t 0
like.” 0

Lukasiewicz 0
believed 0
CNN 0
would 0
reach 0
a 0
compromise 0
with 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
rather 0
than 0
engage 0
in 0
a 0
prolonged 0
court 0
battle. 0

“The 0
law 0
and 0
the 0
Constitution 0
is 0
very 0
clear 0
here,” 0
he 0
said. 0

CNN’s 0
suit 0
received 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
dozen 0
news 0
organizations 0
including 0
Fox 0
News, 0
where 0
commentators 0
have 0
often 0
echoed 0
Trump’s 0
criticisms 0
of 0
the 0
network’s 0
coverage. 0

Rival 0
news 0
organizations 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
defense 0
of 0
Fox 0
News 0
in 0
2009 0
when 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
attempted 0
to 0
exclude 0
its 0
reporters 0
from 0
interviews 0
with 0
officials 0
that 0
were 0
offered 0
to 0
all 0
other 0

Fox 0
News 0
commentators 0
were 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
harshest 0
critics 0
during 0
his 0
eight 0
years 0
in 0
office, 0
and 0
he 0
often 0
complained 0
about 0
it 0

But 0
the 0
press 0

In 0
his 0
speech, 0
he 0
encouraged 0
those 0
listening 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
alone, 0
and 0
said 0
the 0

of 0
the 0
people 0
was 0
meant 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
voice 0
to 0
the 0
UK 0
government 0
to 0
"Free 0
Tommy 0
Robinson!" 0

Batten 0
echoed 0
that 0
sentiment 0
saying, 0
“Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
a 0
political 1
prisoner." 1

“Whatever 0
the 0
legal 0
technicalities 0
of 0
his 0
alleged 0
contempt 0
of 0
court, 0
he 0
was 0
imprisoned 0
more 0
for 0
who 0
he 0
is 0
and 0
what 0
he 0
says 0
rather 0
than 0
what 0
he 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
have 0
done.," 0
he 0
added. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
necessary 0
to 0
agree 0
with 0
everything 0
he 0
says, 0
it’s 0
not 0
necessary 0
to 0
approve 0
of 0
everything 0
he 0
does, 0
but 0
history 0
will 0
judge 0
him 0
as 0
being 0
on 0
the 0
right 0
side 0
of 0
a 0
struggle 1
between 1
good 1
and 1
evil,” 1
Batten 0
continued. 0

He 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
blast 0
the 0
policies 0
of 0
the 0
UK 0
that 0
are 0
truly 0
harming 0
their 0
own 0
people, 0
specifically 0
“widespread, 1
organized, 1
paedophile 1
rape 1
of 1
little 1
girls 1
by 1
organized 1
gangs” 1
while 0
those 0
in 0
authority 0
“brush 0
it 0
under 0
the 0
carpet.” 0

“Governments 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
and 0
across 0
Europe 0
are 0
now 0
the 0
enemies 1
of 0
their 0
own 0
people, 0
[and] 0
they 0
promote 0
policies 0
that 0
are 0
against 0
the 0
interests 0
of 0
their 1
own 1
people,” 1
he 0
railed 0
citing 0
efforts 0
to 0
sabotage 0
Brexit, 0
uncontrolled 0
mass 0
migration, 0
and 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
“Islamisation” 0
in 0
particular," 0
he 0
said. 0

“A 0
literalist 0
interpretation 0
of 0
the 0
Mohammedan 0
cult 0
is 0
completely 0
alien 0
to 0
everything 0
our 1
country 1
stands 0
for 0
and 0
our 1
traditional 1
way 1
of 1
life," 1
Batten 0
continued. 0

“And 0
yet 0
instead 0
of 0
opposing 0
Islamisation, 0
our 0
government 0
is 0
submitting 0
and 0
surrendering 0
to 0
it. 0

They 0
have 0
betrayed 1
the 1
British 1
people." 1

“Now, 0
‘Islam’ 0
means 0
‘Submission’. 0

You 1
either 1
submit, 1
or 1
you 1
resist. 1

Are 0
you 0
going 0
to 0
submit?” 0
he 0
asked 0
the 0
crowds. 0

“Are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
resist?” 1

The 0
crowd 0
shouted 0
back 0
their 0
support 0
of 0
resisting 0
and 0
not 0
submitting 0
to 0
the 0
Islamization 0
of 0
their 0
culture. 0

Sharia 0
Watch 0
founder 0
Anne 0
Marie 0
Waters 0
also 0
spoke 0
at 0
the 0
rally. 0

“Our 0
leaders, 0
our 0
media, 0
our 0
police, 0
all 0
prioritize 0
Islam 0
in 0
their 0
decision 0
making,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“Why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
easy 1
for 1
our 1
state 1
to 1
jail 1
Tommy 1
Robinson, 1
when 1
it 1

a 1

of 1

found 1
with 1
an 1

in 1

Why 0

“Why 1
is 1
it 1

for 0
leaving 0
bacon 0
at 0

death 0
to 0
the 0
British 1
people?" 1

she 0
continued 0
in 0
a 0
line 0
of 0
questioning. 0

“Why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
easy 1
for 0
judges 0
to 0
make 0
rulings 0
that 0
allow 0
known 0
terrorists 0
and 0
jihadists 0
to 0
stay 0
in 0
our 1
country? 1

Why 0
is 0
the 0
British 0
government 0
allowing 0
ISIS 0
fighters 0
to 0
return 0
from 0
Syria 0
and 0
threaten 0
our 1
safety? 1

“Why 0
do 0
we 0
talk 0

investigate 0
and 0
get 0
angry 0
about 0
an 0
accidental 0
fire 0
in 0

about 0
the 0
deliberate, 0
ideology 0
driven 0
murder 0
of 0
British 1
children?" 1

Waters 0
went 0
on. 0

“And 0
why 1
are 1
Muslims 1
allowed 1
to 1
cover 1
their 1
faces 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
sack 1
while 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
are 1
subject 1
to 1

Why 1
are 0
children 0
being 0
mutilated 1
and 1
forcefully 1
raped 1
while 0
the 1

looks 1
the 1

“Why 1
is 0
it 0
so 0
easy, 0
Theresa 0

Why?” 1
Waters 0
asked. 0

Well, 0
the 0
questions 0
are 0
obviously 0
rhetorical. 0

We 0
know 0
why. 0

The 0
UK 0
is 0
frightened 0
of 0
the 0
Islamists, 0
and 0
by 0
being 0
frightened 0
into 0
submission, 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
complicit 0
in 0
the 0
crimes 0
of 0

there. 0

My 0

Kassam 0
also 0
spoke 0
at 0
the 0
event, 0
reminding 0
supporters 0
of 0
what 0
was 0
happening 0
all 0
across 0
Europe 0
due 0
the 0
mass 0
influx 0
of 0
Muslim 0
migrants. 0

Then 0
he 0
encouraged 0
them 0
with 0
a 0
piece 0
of 0
American 0
history. 0

“I’m 0
sure 0
we 0
have 0
some 0
American 1
friends 1
in 0
the 0
crowd, 0
on 0
stage, 0
and 0
watching 0
at 0
home,” 0
Kassam 0
concluded. 0

“You 0
know 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
man 0
called 0
Paul 0
Revere. 0

He 0
rode 0
through 0
the 0
night 0
on 0
his 0
horse. 0

He 0
said, 0
‘The 0
British 0
are 0
coming, 0
the 0
British 0
are 0
coming!’ 0
Well, 0
let 0
you 0
tell 0
you 0
something; 0
we’re 0
here 0
today 0
to 0
say 0
a 0
similar 0
thing: 0
The 1
British 1
are 1
coming 1
back!” 1

I 0
do 0
hope 0
that 0
is 0
true, 0
but 0
unless 0
the 0
Brits 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
same 0
kind 0
of 0
fear 0
in 0
their 0
representatives 0
that 0
the 0
Muslims 0
are 0
doing, 0
they 0
can't 0
expect 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
they 0
want 0
to 0
do. 0

What 0
Britain 0
needs 0
is 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
the 1
God 1
of 1
their 1
forefathers, 1
the 0
One 0
Oliver 0
Cromwell 0
served. 0

They 0
need 0
to 0
fear 0
Him 0
more 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
the 0
Islamic 0
terrorists 0
and 0
rape 0
gangs. 0

Then, 1
and 1
only 1
then, 1
will 0
they 0
render 0
justice 0
for 0
the 0
Muslim 0
criminals, 0
rid 0
their 0
land 0
of 0
such 0
public 0
idolatry 1
and 0
protect 0
the 0
people 0
like 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
who 0
rightly 0
tell 0
the 0
truth. 0

of 0

since 0
they 0
too 0
push 0
political 0
messages 0
for 0

(waaah, 0

as 0
do 0
all 0
the 0
other 0

out 0
there, 0
they 0

over 0
800 0
U.S. 0
accounts 0
and 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
accounts 0
were 0
also 0
suspended 0
by 0
Twitter 0
shortly 0
thereafter 0
should 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
this 1
is 1
a 1
coordinated 1
effort 1
to 1
silence 1
large 1
swaths 1
of 1
the 1
population. 1

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
best 0
coverage 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
from…Russia. 0

Sputnik 0
News 0
contacted 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
alternative 0
journalists 0
who 0
were 0
purged 0
to 0
get 0
their 0
take 0
on 0
what 0
happened. 0

You 0
may 0
recall 0
that 0
basically 0
every 0
blogger 0
outside 0
the 0
establishment 0
media 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
being 0
secretly 0
Russian 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
by 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
so 0
perhaps 0
actual 0
Russians 0
have 0
a 0
vested 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
truth 0
coming 0
out 0
on 0
this 0
topic. 0

My 0
friend 0
John 0
Vibes 0
is 0
an 1
amazing 1
person 1
who 0
contributes 0
to 0
The 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project. 0

He 0
said: 0

This 0
signifies 0
a 0
re 0
consolidation 0
of 0
the 0
media. 0

Cable 0
news 0
media 0
controlled 0
the 0
narrative 0
for 0
most 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
but 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
lowered 0
that 0
barrier 0
to 0
entry 0
and 0
allowed 0
the 0
average 0
person 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
media 0
themselves. 0

This 0
obviously 0
took 0
market 0
share 0
and 0
influence 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
traditional 0
media, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
allowed 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
diverse 0
public 0
conversation. 0

Now 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
platforms 0
that 0
have 0
monopolized 0
the 0
industry 0
are 0
favoring 0
mainstream 0
sources 0
and 0
silencing 0
alternative 0
voices. 0

So 0
now, 0
instead 0
of 0
allowing 0
more 0
people 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
voice, 0
these 0
platforms 0
are 0
creating 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
where 0
only 0
powerful 0
media 0
organizations 0
are 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
had 0
on 0
cable 0
news. 0

People 0
think 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
just 0
providing 0
an 0
activist 0
spin 0
on 0
the 0
news, 0
but 0
they 0
don’t 0
see 0
the 0
families 0
struggling 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
voice 0
heard. 0

For 0
example, 0
when 0
someone 0
is 0
shot 0
by 0
police, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
sources 0
often 0
just 0
republish 0
the 0
press 0
release 0
from 0
the 0
police 0
department, 0
without 0
presenting 0
the 0
victim’s 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story. 0

We 0
give 0
the 0
victims 0
and 0
their 0
families 0
a 0
voice, 0
which 0
is 0
essential 0
to 0
keep 0
power 0
in 0
check. 0

This 0
also 0
goes 0
for 0
bigger 0
issues 0
like 0
foreign 0
policy 0
as 0
well; 0
multiple 0
full 0
scale 0
invasions 0
of 0
Syria 0
have 0
been 0
prevented 0
because 0
of 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
alternative 0
media 0
made 0
viral. 0

All 0
of 0
our 0

professionally 0

I 0
got 0
into 0
this 0
line 0
of 0
work 0
because 0
I 0
felt 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
need 0
for 0
media 0
that 0
challenged 0
mainstream 0
assumptions 0
and 0
biases 0
in 0
politics. 0

I 0
wanted 0
to 0
shed 0
light 0
on 0
corruption 0
and 0
wrongdoing 0
against 0
oppressed 0
peoples 0
and 0
cover 0
the 0
harsh 1
truth 1
about 0
American 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Over 0
the 0
last 0
28 0
days, 0
we 0
reached 0
7,088,000 0
people 0
on 0
Facebook. 0

The 0
timing 0
of 0
this 0
purge 0
is 0
rather 0
dubious 1
in 0
my 0
view, 0
coming 0
shortly 0
before 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections. 0

This 1
could 1
be 1
an 1
attempt 1
by 1
Facebook 1
itself 1
to 1
affect 1
the 1
outcome 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
elections. 1

The 0
Twitter 0
suspension 0
caught 0
me 0
by 0
surprise. 0

I 0
can 0
only 0
speculate 0
that 0
these 0
suspensions 0
were 0
a 1
coordinated 1
effort 1
to 1
stifle 1
our 1
message 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1

Remember, 0
this 0
is 0
coordinated, 1
across 0
multiple 0
platforms. 0

Remember 0
when 0
this 0
happened 0
to 0
Alex 0
Jones? 0

Back 0
in 0
September, 0
an 0
assault 1
was 0
led 0
by 0
YouTube, 0
Google, 0
and 0
Facebook 0
against 0
Alex 0
Jones 0
of 0
Infowars 0
fame. 0

All 0
of 0
his 0
accounts 0
were 0
shut 0
down 0
in 0
quick 0
succession, 0
followed 0
by 0
his 0
credit 0
card 0
processing 0
companies 0
and 0
his 0
newsletter 0
service 0
providers. 0

I 0
wrote 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
“Alex 0
Jones 0
is 0
just 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
this 0
purge. 0

It’s 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
much 0
worse.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
other 0
dissenting 0
voices 0
were 0
being 0
silenced 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
with 0
limited 0
reach 0
and 0
“shadow 0
banning.” 0

Infowars 0
is 0
a 0
massive 0
profit 0
machine. 0

But 0
what 0
happens 0
when 0
similar 0
attacks 0
are 0
launched 0
on 0
smaller 0
alternative 0
media 0
outlets? 0

It 0
hits 0
us 0
right 0
in 0
the 0
wallet. 0

And 0
if 0
they’re 0
hit 0
hard 0
enough, 0
they’ll 0
cease 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
function. 0

Jones 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
money 0
so 0
this 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
him, 0
but 0
for 0
most 0
website 0
owners, 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
absolute 0
end 0
of 0
our 0
ability 0
to 0
do 0
business. 0

And 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
bring 0
the 0
information 0
we 0
bring, 0
we 0
do 0
have 0
to 0
run 0
our 0
websites 0
as 0
businesses. 0

It’s 0
far 0
more 0
expensive 0
than 0
most 0
people 0
realize 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
site. 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
my 0
own 0
operating 0
costs 0
every 0
month 0
are 0
more 0
than 0
$2000. 0

A 0
site 0
as 0
big 0
as 0
Jones’s 0
would 0
be 0
many 0
times 0
that 0
amount. 0

When 0
all 0
your 0
avenues 0
of 0
monetization 0
are 0
cut 0
off, 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
hard 0
for 0
a 0
site 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
dissent 0
and 0
information 0
they 0
share 0
– 0
to 0
cease 0

Ron 0
Paul, 0
former 0
senator 0
and 0
the 0
libertarian 0
voice 0
of 0
reason, 0
said 0
when 0
Jones 0
was 0
purged: 0

“You 0
get 0
accused 0
of 0
treasonous 0
activity 0
and 0
treasonous 0
speech 0
because 0
in 0
an 0
empire 1
of 1
lies 1
the 0
truth 0
is 0
treason,” 0
Paul 0
told 0
the 0
Russia 0
based 0
news 0
outlet. 0

“Challenging 0
the 0
status 0
quo 0
is 0
what 0
they 0
can’t 0
stand 0
and 0
it 0
unnerves 0
them, 0
so 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
silence 0
people.” 0
“Some 0
of 0
us 0
tell 0
the 0

they 0
call 0
us 0

adding 0
that 0

hopes 0
anti 0

anti 0
war 0

can 0

Here’s 0
a 0
video 0
from 0
last 0
month 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Paul’s 0
thoughts 0
about 0
the 0
social 0
media 0
purge. 0

In 0
it, 0
he 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
Facebook 0
is 0
a 0
private 0
entity 0
so 0
they 0
do 0
have 0
every 0
right 0
to 0
remove 0
the 0
pages 0
they 0
wish. 0

The 0
danger 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
area 0
in 0
which 0
this 0
treads 0
on 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
– 0
is 0
their 0
direct 0
ties 0
to 0
the 0
government. 0

This 0
affects 0
everyone. 0

If 0
you’re 0
reading 0
this 0
and 0
you 0
shrug 0
because 0
you, 0
personally, 0
don’t 0
have 0
a 0
Twitter 0
or 0
Facebook 0
account, 0
you’re 0
missing 0
the 0
bigger 0
point. 0

Consider 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
“population” 0
of 0
Facebook 0
is 0
bigger 0
than 0
the 0
populations 0
of 0
the 0
US, 0
China, 0
and 0
Brazil 0
combined. 0

That’s 0
how 0
many 0
people 0
will 0
now 0
only 0
receive 0
one 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
on 0
things 0
like 0
war, 0
politics, 0
guns, 0
and 0
current 0
events. 0

People 0
will 0
believe 0
what 0
they’re 0
told 0
because 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
alternative 0
information 0
presented. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
questions 0
asked. 0

It’s 0
literally 0
the 0
textbook 0
definition 0
of 0
brainwashing. 1

Definition 0
of 0
brainwashing 1

1: 0
a 0
forcible 1
indoctrination 0
to 0
induce 0
someone 0
to 0
give 0
up 0

brainwashing 0

Social 0
media 0
is 0
a 0
massive 0
source 0
of 0
information 0

influence 0
today. 0

If 0

entities 0
that 0
support 0
socialism, 0

the 0

we’re 1
doomed. 1

2.2 0

any 0

So 0
regardless 0
of 0
whether 0
you, 0
personally, 0
participate, 0
this 0
will 0
color 0
popular 0
sentiment 0
to 0
a 0

It 0
will 0
grow 0
the 0

people 0

things 0
like 0
“the 1
government 1

that 0
“you 1
don’t 1
need 1
to 1
protect 1
yourself, 1
the 1

will 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
you.” 1

What 0
can 0
you 0
do 0
about 0
the 0
alternative 0

It’s 0
possible 0
but 0
unlikely 0
that 0
social 0

The 0

the 0
military/security 0

amplified 0
by 0
the 0

the 0
senators 0
and 0
representatives 0
that 0
the 1
insouciant 1
American 1
voters 1
think 0
that 0
they 0
elect. 0

Do 0
you 0
know 0
how 0
large 0
1,000 0

is? 0

You 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
live 0

do 0
nothing 0
for 0
24/7 0

figure. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
sum 0
that 0
nurtures 0
the 0
recipients, 0
and 0
the 0
recipients 0
regard 0
it 0
as 0
worth 0
protecting. 0

Therefore, 0
the 0
American 0
public 0
gets 0
not 0
representation, 0
but 0
lies 0
that 0
justify 0
war 0
and 0
conflict. 0

The 0

complex, 0
about 0
which 0
President 0
Eisenhower 0
warned 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
to 0
no 0

is 0
in 0
desperate 0
need 0
of 0
an 0

In 0
obedience 0
to 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex, 0
the 0
Clinton, 0
George 0
W. 0

do 0
not 0
understand 0
this, 0
they 0
will 0
easily 0
be 0
made 0

For 0
example, 0
during 0
the 0
last 0
half 0
of 0
the 0
1970s 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Senate 0
staff. 0

I 0
was 0
working 0
together 0
with 0
a 0
staffer 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Republican 0
Senator 0
from 0
California, 0
S. 0
I. 0
Hayakawa, 0
to 0

to 0
the 0
stagflation 0
that 0
threatened 0
the 0
US 0

ability 0
to 0
meet 0
its 0
obligations. 0

Republican 0
Senators 0
Hatch, 0
Roth, 0
and 0
Hayakawa 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
introduce 0
a 0
supply 0
side 0
economic 0
policy 0
as 0
a 0
cure 0
for 0
the 0
stagflation 0
that 0
was 0
threatening 0
the 0
US 0
economy 0
with 0
failure. 0

The 0
Democrats, 0
who 0
later 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
led 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
a 0
supply 0
side 0
policy, 0
were, 0
at 0
this 0
time, 0
opposed 0
(see 0
Paul 0
Craig 0
Roberts, 0
The 0
Supply 0
Side 0
Revolution, 0
Harvard 0
University 0
Press, 0
1984). 0

The 0
Democrats 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
policy 0
would 0
worsen 0
the 0
budget 0
deficit, 0
the 0
only 0
time 0
in 0
those 0
days 0
Democrats 0
cared 0
about 0
the 0
budget 0
deficit. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
said 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
support 0
the 0
tax 0
rate 0
reductions 0
if 0
the 0
Republicans 0
would 0
support 0
offsetting 0
cuts 0
in 0
the 0
budget 0
to 0
support 0
a 0
balanced 0
budget. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
ploy 0
to 0
put 0
Republicans 0
on 0
the 0
spot 0
for 0
taking 0
away 0
some 0
groups’ 0
handouts 0
in 0
order 0
“to 0
cut 0
tax 0
rates 0
for 0
the 0

The 0
supply 0
side 0
policy 0
did 0
not 0
require 0
budget 0
cuts, 0
but 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
the 0
Democrats 0
lack 0
of 0
sincerety, 0
Hayakawa’s 0
aid 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
our 0
senators 0
introduce 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
budget 0
cuts 0
together 0
with 0
tax 0
cuts 0
that, 0
on 0
a 0
static 0
revenue 0
basis 0
(not 0
counting 0
tax 0
revenue 0
feedbacks 0
from 0
the 0
incentives 0
of 0
the 0
lower 0
tax 0
rates) 0
kept 0
the 0
budget 0
even, 0
and 0
the 0
Democrats 0
voted 0
against 0
them 0
every 0
time. 0

When 0
the 0
combination 0
of 0
tax 0
cuts 0
with 0
defense 0
budget 0
cuts 0
came 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
vote, 0
the 1
legendary 1
senator 1
Strom 0
Thurmond, 0
a 0
48 0
year 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Senate 0
from 0
South 0
Carolina, 0
tapped 0
me 0
on 0
the 0
shoulder. 0

He 0
said: 0
“son, 1
never 1
set 1
your 1
senator 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex. 1

He 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
re 1
elected, 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
job.” 1
I 0
replied 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
just 0
establishing 0
for 0
the 0
record 0
that 0
under 0
no 0
conditions 0
would 0
the 0
Democrats, 0
who 0
wanted 0
more 0
government, 0
vote 0
for 0
a 0
tax 0

reduction 0
even 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
case 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
cure 0

He 0
replied: 0
“son, 0
the 1

doesn’t 1
care.” 1

My 0
emergence 1
from 1
The 1
Matrix 1
began 0
with 0
Thurmond’s 0
pat 0
on 0
my 0

It 0
grew 0
with 0
my 0
time 0

said. 0

In 0
the 0
Treasury 0
I 0
experienced 0
how 0
those 0
outside 0
interests 0
opposed 0
to 0
a 0
president’s 0
policy 0
marshall 1
their 1
forces 1
and 0
the 0
media 0
that 0
they 0
own 0
to 0
block 0
it. 0

Later 0
as 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
secret 0
presidential 0
committee, 0
I 0
saw 0
how 0
the 0
CIA 0
attempted 0
to 0
prevent 0
President 0
Reagan 0
from 0
ending 0
the 0
Cold 0
War. 0

Today, 1
right 1
now, 1
at 1
this 1
moment, 1
we 1
are 1
faced 1
with 1
a 1
massive 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex, 1
the 1
neoconservatives, 1
the 1
Democratic 1
Party, 1
and 1
the 1
presstitute 1
media 1
to 1
discredit 1
the 1
elected 1
President 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
and 1
to 1
overthrow 1
him 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
the 1
utterly 1
corrupt 1
elite 1
that 1
rule 1
American 1
can 1
continue 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
power 1
and 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
massive 1
budget 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex 1
that, 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
Israel 1
Lobby, 1
funds 1
the 1
elections 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
rule 1
us. 1

Trump, 0
like 0
Reagan, 0
was 0
an 0
exception, 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
exceptions 0
that 0
accumulate 0
the 0
ire 0
of 0
the 0
corrupt 0
leftwing, 0
bought 0
off 0
with 0
money, 0
and 0
the 1
ire 1
of 1
the 1
media, 1
concentrated 0
into 0
small 0
tight 0
ownership 0
groups 0
indebted 0

those 0
who 0
permitted 0
the 0
illegal 0
concentration 0
of 0
a 0
once 0
independent 0

diverse 0
American 0
media 0
that 0
once 0
served, 0
on 0
occasion, 0
as 0
a 1
watchdog 1
over 1
government. 1

The 1
rightwing, 1
wrapped 1
in 1
the 1

dismisses 1
all 1
truth 1
as 1
“anti 1

they 1
are 1
insane. 1

Their 0

are 0
setting 0

up 0
for 0

There 0
is 0

is 0

The 0
entire 0

by 0

led 0
by 0
John 0

The 0
purpose 0
is 0
to 0
discredit 0

for 0
two 0
reasons. 0

One 0
is 0
to 0
prevent 0
any 0
normalization 0
of 0

with 0

The 0
other 0
is 0
to 0

what 0

in 0
Russian 0
Defense 0

Shoigu 0
has 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 1
aggressive 1
actions 1
of 1
the 1

against 1

If 0

doesn’t 0
listen 0
to 0
him, 0
Russia 0
is 0
in 1
the 1
trash 1

of 1

Keep 1
in 1
mind 1
that 1
no 1
media 1
informs 1
you 1
better 1
than 1
my 1
website. 1

If 0
my 0
website 0
goes 0
down, 0
you 0
will 0
be 0

darkness. 0

No 1
valid 1
information 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
US 1

or 1

If 1

in 1

of 1
the 1
TV 1

watching 1
the 1

you 1

Not 1
even 1
I 1
can 1
rescue 1
you. 1

Nor 1
God 1
himself. 1

Americans, 0
and 0
indeed 0
the 0
Russians 0
themselves, 0
are 0
incapable 0
of 0
realizing 0
it, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
chance 0
that 0
Trump 0
will 0
be 0
overthrown 0
and 0
a 0
Western 0
assault 0
will 0
be 0
launched 0
against 0
the 0
handful 0
of 0
countries 0
that 0
insist 0
on 0
sovereignty. 0

I 1
doubt 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
Americans 1
who 1
elected 1
Trump 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
anti 1
Trump 1
propagana, 1
but 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
organized 0
and 0
have 0
no 0
armed 0
power. 0

The 0
police, 0
militarized 0
by 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
Obama, 0
will 0
be 0
set 0
against 0
them. 0

The 0
rebellions 0
will 0
be 0
local 0
and 0
suppressed 0
by 0
every 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Constitution 0
by 0
the 0
private 0
powers 0
that 0
rule 0
Washington, 0
as 0
always 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
case 0
with 0
rebellions 0
in 0
America. 0

In 1
the 1
West, 1
which 1
the 1
Russians 1
are 1
so 1
anxious 1
to 1
join, 1
all 1
freedoms 1
are 1
dead 1
freedom 0

the 0
Constitutional 0
protections 0
of 0

Today 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
countries 1
less 1
free 1
than 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
of 1
America. 1

Why 0
do 0
the 0
Russian 0
Atlanticist 0
Integrationists 0
want 0
to 0
join 0
an 0
unfree 0
Western 0
world? 0

Are 0
they 0
that 0
brainwashed 1
by 0
Western 0
Propaganda? 0

If 0
Putin 0
listens 0
to 0
these 0
deluded 1
fools, 1
Putin 0
will 0
destroy 0
Russia. 0

There 0
is 0
something 0
wrong 0
with 0
Russian 0
perception 0
of 0
Washington. 0

Apparently 0
the 0
Russian 0
elite, 0
with 0
the 0
exception 0
of 0
Shoigu 0
and 0
a 0
few 0
others 0
are 0
incapable 0
of 0
comprehending 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
drive 0
for 0
US 0
world 0
hegemony 0
and 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
determination 0
to 0
destroy 0
Russia 0
as 0
a 0
constraint 0
on 0
US 0
unilateralism. 0

The 0
Russian 0
government 0
somehow, 0
despite 0
all 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary, 0
believes 0
that 0
Washington’s 0

Stacey 0

ended 0
her 0
run 0
for 0

rights 0

policies. 0

As 0
state 0
officials 0
prepare 0

the 0
vote, 0
Abrams 0
acknowledged 0
the 0
law 0
“allows 0
no 0

remedy” 0
to 0
extend 0
her 0
quest 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
nation’s 0
first 0
black 0
female 0
governor. 0

But 0
she 0
laced 0
her 0
speech 0
with 0
biting 0
criticism 0
of 0
Kemp, 0
who 0
she 0
accused 0
of 0
leveraging 0
his 0
role 0
as 0
the 0
state’s 0
top 0
elections 0
official 0
to 0
suppress 0
voters. 0

“I 0
will 0
not 0
concede,” 0
she 0
added, 0
“because 0
the 0
erosion 0
of 0
our 0
democracy 0
is 0
not 0
right.” 0

You 1
mean 1
like 1
having 1
a 1
sister 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
wings 1
of 1
any 1
campaign 1
lawsuits, 1
Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

What 1
about 1
invalid 1
provisional 1
ballots 1
getting 1
mixed 1
in 1

valid 1
ones? 1

Maybe 1
a 1

Ms. 1

How 1
about 1
non 1

Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

Are 0
these 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0

Sure 0
they 0
are 0
and 0
they 0
appear 0
to 0
all 0
be 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
party 0
that 0
Stacey 0
Abrams 0
represents, 0
but 0
she's 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
that. 0

But 0
she 0
wasn't 0
going 0
to 0
concede. 0

Nope, 0
that 0
arrogant 0
wanna 0
be 0
first 0
female 0
governor 0
of 0
Georgia 0
simply 0
would 0
not 0
bow 0
out 0
gracefully. 0

“To 0
watch 0
an 0
elected 0
official 0
who 0
claims 0
to 0
represent 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
this 0
state 0
baldly 1
pin 1
his 1

for 0
election 0
on 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
the 0
people’s 0
democratic 0
right 0
to 0
vote 0
has 0
been 0
truly 0
appalling,” 0
Abrams 0
said. 0

“So, 0
let’s 0
be 0
clear," 0
she 0
continued. 0

"This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
speech 0
of 0
concession. 0

Because 0
concession 0
means 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
an 0
action 0
is 0
right, 0
true 0
or 0
proper. 0

As 0
a 0
woman 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
faith, 0
I 0
cannot 0
concede 0
that. 0

But 0
my 0
assessment 0
is 0
the 0
law 0
currently 0
allows 0
no 0
further 0
viable 0
remedy.” 0

No, 0
concession 0
means 0
"a 0
thing 0
that 0
is 0
granted, 0
especially 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
demands; 0
a 0
thing 0
conceded." 0

Abrams 0
was 0
easily 0
defeated 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
votes. 0

She 0
was 0
the 0
one 0
trying 0
to 0
"find" 0
and 0
count 0
votes 0
remember? 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
claiming 0
there 0
was 0
cancellation 0
of 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
voter 0
registrations. 0

Where 0
is 0
her 0

none. 0

Preliminary 0

that 0
the 0
officer 0
arrived 0
home 0
in 0
full 0

after 0
working 0
a 0
full 0
shift. 0

The 0

that 0
she 0

At 0

the 0

fired 0
her 0
weapon 0
striking 0
the 0

Responding 0

administered 0

to 0
the 0
victim, 0
a 0
26 0
year 0
old 0
male, 0
at 0
the 0

The 0

pending 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0

The 0

conducting 0
a 0

investigation 0
with 0
the 0
District 0
Attorney’s 0

This 0

they 0

it 0

I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
you 0
can 0
enter 0
an 0
apartment 0
mistakenly. 0

Does 0
Guyger 0
leave 0
her 0
door 0
unlocked? 0

Furthermore, 0
The 0
Dallas 0
News 0
reports: 0

Jean, 0
who 0
lived 0
on 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
South 0
Side 0
Flats 0
in 0
the 0
Cedars, 0
was 0
home 0
alone 0
when 0
Guyger 0
mistook 0
his 0
apartment 0
for 0
hers, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

Guyger 0
lived 0
on 0
the 0
third 0
floor, 0
directly 0
beneath 0
his 0
apartment, 0
and 0
mistakenly 0
parked 0
on 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
after 0
finishing 0
a 0
shift 0
at 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

When 0
she 0
arrived 0
at 0
Jean's 0
door, 0
Guyger 0
entered 0
a 0
unique 0
door 0
key 0
with 0
an 0
electronic 0
chip 0
into 0
the 0
keyhole, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

The 0
door 0
was 0
already 0
ajar, 0
so 0
the 0
force 0
of 0
pushing 0
the 0
key 0
inside 0
opened 0
the 0
door, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
affidavit. 0

The 1
affidavit 1
says 1
the 0
apartments' 0
"respective 0
interior 0
floorplans 0
are 0
in 0
most 0
ways 0
identical 0
or 0
extremely 0
similar." 0

The 0
apartment 0
was 0
dark 0
and 0
when 0
she 0
saw 0
"a 0
large 0
silhouette," 0
Guyger 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
being 0
burglarized, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

The 1
affidavit 1
says 1
Guyger 0
drew 0
her 0
gun, 0
"gave 0
verbal 0
commands 0
that 0
were 0
ignored" 0
and 0
fired 0
twice. 0

Jean 0
was 0
struck 0
once 0
in 0
the 0
torso. 0

Guyger 0
then 0
called 0
911 0
from 0
her 0
cellphone 0
and 0
started 0
performing 0
first 0
aid. 0

She 0
turned 0
on 0
the 0
lights, 0
then 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
front 0
door 0
again 0
and 0
realized 0
the 0
apartment 0
wasn't 0
hers, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

She 0
told 0
the 0
911 0
operator 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
responding 0
officers 0
that 0
she 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
her 0
apartment 0
when 0
she 0
shot 0
Jean, 0
according 1
to 1
the 1
affidavit. 1

Ok, 0
some 0
of 0
this 0
seems 0
plausible, 0
but 0
I 0
still 0
am 0
left 0
wondering 0
about 0
the 0
door 0
being 0
ajar. 0

Is 0
this 0
something 0
people 0
are 0
prone 0
to 0
do 0
at 0
1o 0
o'clock 0
at 0
night 0
in 0
Dallas? 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
we 0
all 0
know 0
that 0
any 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
would 0
have 0
immediately 0
been 0
taken 0
into 0
custody. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
case 0
with 0
Guyger, 0
though 0
one 0
officer 0
close 0
to 0
her 0
said, 0
"she 0
is 0
devastated." 0

Knowing 0
this 0
provoked 0
outrage 0
across 0
the 0
nation 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
her 0
first 0
shooting. 0

As 0
a 0
four 0
year 0
veteran 0
of 0
the 0
force, 0
she 0
was 0
also 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
shooting 0
of 0
another 0
suspect 0
in 0
2017. 0

The 0
Dallas 0
News 0
reported: 0

In 0
2017, 0
Guyger 0
shot 0
47 0
year 0
old 0
Uvaldo 0
Perez, 0
who 0
had 0
wrestled 0
a 0
Taser 0
away 0
from 0
her. 0

Another 0
officer 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
a 0
Pleasant 0
Grove 0
neighborhood 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
woman 0
who 0
had 0
a 0
warrant 0
out 0
for 0
her 0
arrest. 0

When 0
the 0
officer 0
thought 0
he 0
saw 0
the 0
woman 0
in 0
a 0
car 0
with 0
two 0
men 0
in 0
the 0
8300 0
block 0
of 0
Reva 0
Street, 0
the 0
officer 0
asked 0
for 0
backup 0
from 0
Guyger 0
and 0
another 0
officer, 0
according 0
to 0
an 0
affidavit. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
officers 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
search 0
Perez 0
when 0
he 0
became 0
combative, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
said. 1

Guyger 0
deployed 0
her 0
Taser 0
before 0
Perez 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
take 0
it 0
from 0
her. 0

After 0
Perez 0
had 0
the 0
Taser, 0
Guyger 0
fired 0
her 0
gun 0
once, 0
striking 0
him 0
in 0
the 0
abdomen, 0
the 0
affidavit 0
said. 0

Neither 0
Guyger 0
nor 0
the 0
other 0
officers 0
were 0
injured 0
in 0
the 0
2017 0
shooting. 0

Police 0
arrested 0
Perez 0
on 0
a 0
charge 0
of 0
taking 0
a 0
weapon 0
from 0
an 0
officer, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
charges 0
for 0
possession 0
of 0
methamphetamine, 0
marijuana 0
and 0
violating 0
his 0
parole. 0

In 0
February 0
2018, 0
Perez 0
signed 0
a 0
plea 0
agreement 0
for 0
the 0
charge 0
of 0
taking 0
an 0
officer's 0
weapon 0
and 0
was 0

two 0
years 0

Trump 0
Kept 0
Asking 0
Friends 0
If 0
the 0
Mueller 0
Report 0
Would 0
Drop 0
This 0
Week 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
was 0
flying 0
to 0
a 0
military 0
tank 0
plant 0
in 0
Lima, 0
Ohio, 0
to 0
deliver 0
a 0
speech 0
on 0
the 0
economy, 0
but, 0
as 0
is 0
frequently 0
the 0
case, 0
the 0
president 0
had 0
something 0
more 0
pressing 0
on 0
his 0
mind. 0

While 0
aboard 0
Air 0
Force 0
One, 0
the 0
president 0
killed 0
some 0
time 0
by 0
picking 0
up 0
the 0
phone 0
and 0
ringing 0
associates 0
to 0
ask 0
them 0
if 0
they 0
thought 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller’s 0
report 0
would 0
be 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
this 0
week, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
source 0
with 0
knowledge 0
of 0
these 0
conversations. 0

The 0
report, 0
which 0
would 0
mark 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team’s 0
investigation 0
into 0
alleged 0
Russian 0
interference 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
election 0
and 0
potential 0
obstruction 0
of 0
justice, 0
has 0
for 0
many 0
months 0
kicked 0
off 0
round 0
after 0
round 0
of 0
speculation 0
among 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
political 0
class 0
about 0
when, 0
exactly, 0
it 0
will 0
finally 0
be 0
delivered 0
to 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

This 0
week, 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
himself 0
joined 0
in 0
on 0
the 0
anxious 0
anticipation 0
and 0
the 1
Mueller 1
report 1
guessing 1
game. 1

According 0
to 0
three 0
knowledgeable 0
sources, 0
Trump 0
has 0
quizzed 0
various 0
people 0
administration 0
officials, 0
friends, 0
his 0
legal 0
team 0
throughout 0
the 0
week 0
if 0
they 0
believed 0
the 0
buzz 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
could 0
be 0
delivered 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
week. 0

The 0
president, 0
these 0
sources 0
said, 0
speculated 0
on 0
when 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
finally 0
happen, 0
repeatedly 0
citing 0
news 0
reports 0
from 0
this 0
week 0
on 0
a 0
possible 0
imminent 0
delivery. 0

Reached 0
for 0
comment, 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders 0
replied 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
“nothing 1
to 1
add 1
right 1
now,” 1
as 0
of 0
Friday 0
afternoon. 0

“I 0
told 0
the 0
president 0
this 0
morning 0
[to] 0
go 0
about 0
your 0
schedule, 0
we’re 0
prepared 0
for 0
anything,” 0
Rudy 0
Giuliani, 0
one 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
personal 0
attorneys, 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Beast 0
on 0
Friday, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
president 0
in 0
person 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

Giuliani 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
the 0
president 0
have 0
been 0
hearing 0
the 0
report 0
delivery 0
could 0
happen 0
“today,” 0
but 0
clarified 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
client 0
are 0
going 0
off 0
of 0
media, 0
not 0
any 0
“insider 0
information.” 0

Trump’s 0
reelection 0
campaign 0
also 0
got 0
in 0
on 0
this 0
week’s 0
speculation 0
game, 1
texting 0
supporters 0
early 0
Friday 0
afternoon, 0
“President 0
Trump 0
has 0
put 0
up 0
with 0
the 1
WITCH 1
HUNT 1
for 0
2 0
YEARS. 0

Do 0
you 0
think 0
it's 0
time 0
for 0
it 0
to 0
end? 0

Take 0
our 0
OFFICIAL 0
poll 0
NOW.” 0

The 0
president, 0
who 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
is 0
“illegal” 0
and 0
a 1
“WITCH 1
HUNT” 1
driven 0
by 0
angry 1
liberals, 1
made 0
clear 0
to 0
reporters 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
earlier 0
this 0
week 0
that 0
the 0
coming 0
report 0
was, 0
of 0
course, 0
weighing 0
on 0
him. 0

“Let 1
it 1
come 1
out, 1
let 1
people 1
see 1
it,” 1
Trump 0
said, 0
characterizing 0
the 0
probe 0
and 0
report 0
as 0
“ridiculous,” 1
as 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“Let’s 0
see 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
it’s 0
legit.” 0

But 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
he 0
hasn’t 0
always 0
been 0
so 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
report 0
seeing 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
day, 0
or 0
even 0
having 0
the 0
investigation 0
conclude. 0

As 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reported 0
early 0
last 0
year, 0
Trump 0
ordered 0
the 0
firing 0
of 0
the 0
special 0
counsel, 0
but 0
reversed 0
course 0
after 0
the 0
then 0
White 0
House 0
Counsel 0
Don 0
McGahn 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
resign 1
instead 1
of 1
executing 1
Trump’s 1
order. 1

Still, 0
even 0
after 0
the 0
Mueller 0
probe 0
officially 0
wraps, 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
the 0
beginning, 0
not 0
a 0
dramatic 0
end, 0
to 0
Trumpworld’s 1
wide 1
ranging 1
legal 1
woes. 1

On 0
Friday, 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reported 0
that 0
Democratic 0
chairs 0
of 0
six 0
different 0
House 0
committees 0
investigating 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
allies 0
are 0
planning 0
on 0
asking 0
the 0
FBI, 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice, 0
and 0

President 0
Trump 0
himself 0
appears 0
to 0
realize 0
that 0
the 1
end 1
is 1
nowhere 1
near. 1

As 0
The 0
Daily 0
Beast 0
reported 0
last 0
month, 0
the 0
president 0
made 0
clear 0
to 0
his 0
outside 0
legal 0
team, 0
which 0
includes 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Jay 0
Sekulow, 0
that 0
he 0
wanted 0
his 0
attorneys 0
sitting 0
tight, 0
even 0
after 0
the 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
is 0
history. 0

Trump 0
broached 0
the 0
topic 0
in 0
multiple 0
conversations 0
beginning 0
late 0
last 0
year, 0
while 0
discussing 0
the 0
other 0
inquiries 0
threatening 0
his 0
presidency 0
and 0
inner 0
circle, 0
chief 0
among 0
them 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York. 0

But 0
if 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
is 0
actually, 0
finally 0
sent 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
by 0
close 0
of 0
business 0
on 0
Friday, 0
the 0
president 0
will 0
be 0
many 0
miles 0
away 0
from 0
it. 0

On 0
Friday 0
morning, 0
Trump 0
flew 0
to 0
Palm 0
Beach, 0
Florida, 0
where 0
he 0
and 0
first 0

Melania 0

were 0
scheduled 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0

The 0
department 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
note 0
that 0
Guyger 0
could 0
appeal 0
this 0
firing 0
under 0
their 0
civil 0
service 0
rules. 0

Officer 0
Guyger 0
was 0
terminated 0
for 0
her 0
actions. 0

She 0
was 0
hired 0
in 0
November 0
2013 0
and 0
was 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
Southeast 0
Patrol 0
Division. 0

Under 0
civil 0
service 0
rules, 0
Officer 0
Guyger 0
has 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
appeal 0
her 0
discipline. 0

This 0
move 0
is 0
noteworthy 0
as 0
the 0
department 0
has 0
been 0
standing 0
up 0
against 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
the 0
officer 0
to 0
be 0
fired. 0

As 0
recently 0
as 0
Friday, 0
Hall 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
saying 0
in 0
part, 0
“There 0
is 0
one 0
overriding 0
reason 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
not 0
taken 0
any 0
administrative 0
or 0
employment 0
action 0
against 0
Officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
the 0
on 0
going 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
into 0
her 0
actions.” 0

Also, 0
in 0
a 0
town 0
hall 0
meeting 0
last 0
week, 0
Hall 0
again 0
stood 0
behind 0
her 0
choice 0
to 0
refuse 0
to 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
claiming 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

“I 0
can’t 0
do 0
that 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
both 0
local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
that 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action. 0

There 0
are 0
civil 0
service 0
laws 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
adhere 0
to,” 0
said 0
Hall. 0

Apparently, 0
it 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

This 0
news 0
will 0
likely 0
be 0
well 0
received 0
by 0
the 0
Jean 0
family 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
activists 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
justice 0
for 0
Botham 0
since 0
the 0
beginning. 0

As 0
TFTP 0
previously 0
reported, 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
not 0
firing 0
Guyger 0
seemed 0
utterly 1
preposterous 1
as 0
she 0
admitted 0
to 0
doing 0
something 0
wrong. 0

While 0
controversy 0
swarms 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
why 0
she 0
may 0
have 0
killed 0
Jean, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
kill 0
him. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

This 0
public 0
servant 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
innocent 1
man’s 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
dead. 0

Because 0
of 0
her 0
actions, 0
this 0
man 0
no 0
longer 0
lives. 0

This 0
alone 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
enough 0
to 0
fire 0
her. 0

Surprisingly 0
enough, 0
NRA 0
spokesperson 0
Dana 0
Loesch 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
firing 0
of 0
Guyger 0
with 0
one 0
word, 0
“Good,” 0
showing 0
her 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
move. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
don’t 0
recall, 0
Loesch 0
sparked 0
controversy 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
by 0
claiming 0
that 0
if 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
were 0
a 0
gun 0
owner, 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
alive 0
today. 0

Indeed, 0
as 0
TFTP 0
reported 0
over 0
the 0
weekend, 0
a 0
father 0
in 0
Prince 0
George’s 0
County 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
officers 0
as 0
they 0
wrongly 0
entered 0
his 0
apartment. 0

He 0
shot 0
two 0
officers. 0

Not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
not 0
arrested, 0
but 0
the 0
police 0
chief 0
praised 0
him 0
and 0
apologized. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
termination, 0
the 0
family’s 0
attorney, 0
Lee 0
Merritt 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
family 0
expressed 0
“satisfaction” 0
with 0
the 0
move. 0

“The 0
Jean 0
family 0
expressed 0
satisfaction 0
in 0
this 0
explanation 0
and 0
in 0
Guyger’s 0
termination. 0

it 0
as 0
an 0
initial 0

that 0

arrived 0
home 0
in 0
full 0
uniform 0
after 0
working 0

At 0

at 0

Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
is 0
conducting 0
a 0
joint 0
investigation 0
with 0
the 0
District 0
Attorney’s 0
Office. 0

This 0
investigation 0
is 0
ongoing 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
release 0
additional 0
details 0
as 0
they 0
become 0
available 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
appropriate 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

If 0
an 0
average 0
citizen 0
walked 0
into 0
the 0
wrong 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
and 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
homeowner, 0
rest 0
assured 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
be 0
in 0

right 0
now. 0

However, 0
instead 0
of 0
immediately 0
arresting 0
the 0
officer 0
for 0
trespassing 0
and 0
murder, 0
she 0
was 0
simply 0
placed 0
on 0
administrative 0
leave 0
a 0
glaring 1
function 0
of 0
blue 1
privilege 1
indeed. 0

“Super 1
scary 1
because 0
the 0
police 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0
protect 0
you 0
and 0
then 0
they 0

killing, 0
maiming, 1
or 0
traumatizing 1
entirely 1
innocent 1
people, 0
this 0

this 0

would 0
walk 0
into 0

that 0
was 0
not 0
hers 0
are 0
unclear. 0

However, 0
what 0
is 0
entirely 0
clear 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
a 0

are 0
now 0

will 0
be 0
grieving 0

hall 0
meeting 0
this 0
week, 0
citizens 0
showed 0
that 0
they 0
still 0
have 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
questions 0
for 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
in 0
regards 0
to 0
the 0
cold 1
blooded 1
killing 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean. 0

On 0
top 0
of 0
questions 0
as 0
to 0
why 0
it 0
took 0
several 0
days 0
to 0
arrest 0
the 0
cop 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Guyger 0
admitted 0
to 0
it 0
were 0
questions 0
like 0
why 0
this 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
threat 1
to 1
society 1
has 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
police 0
force. 0

During 0
the 0
meeting, 0
as 0
Chief 0
Renee 0
Hall 0
dodged 0
several 0
questions 0
over 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
arrest, 0
she 0
did 0
go 0
out 0
of 0
her 0
way 0
to 0
answer 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
why 0
Guyger 0
is 0
still 0
collecting 0
a 0
paycheck 0
from 0
their 0
department. 0

The 0
short 0
of 0
it, 0
according 0
to 0
Hall, 0
is 0
she 0
can’t 0
fire 0
her. 0

“I 0
can’t 0
do 0
that 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
both 0
local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
that 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action. 0

There 0
are 0
civil 0
service 0
laws 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
adhere 0
to,” 0
said 0
Hall. 0

But 0
experts 0
say 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
reports, 0
Justin 0
Moore, 0
a 0
civil 0
rights 0
attorney 0
was 0
a 0
panelist 0
at 0
the 0
meeting 0
and 0
was 0
surprised 0
by 0
the 0
Chief’s 0
comments. 0

“I 0
was 0
completely 0
mystified, 0
and 0
I 0
really 0
didn’t 0
understand 0
where 0
it 0
came 0
from 0
last 0
night. 0

It 0
seemed 0
like 0
Chief 1
Hall 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
informed 1
on 1
the 1
law,” 1
said 0
Moore. 0

WFAA 0
went 0
further 0
and 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
“the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
general 0
orders 0
do 0
allow 0
the 0
chief 0
to 0
take 0
action, 0
saying, 0
‘The 0
Chief 0
of 0
Police 0
may 0
circumvent 0
all 0
formal 0
disciplinary 0
procedures 0
to 0
render 0
an 0
immediate 0
decision 0
when 0
it 0
deems 0
it 0
necessary 0
to 0
preserve 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
department.’” 0

Apparently, 0
this 0
“integrity” 0
is 0
not 0
worth 0
preserving 0
and 0
the 0
Dallas 0
police 0
are 0
going 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
way 0
to 0
keep 0
a 0
killer 1
cop 1
on 0
their 0
payroll. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
pointed 0
out, 0
lots 0
of 0
cops 0
across 0
the 0
state 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
under 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
have 0
been 0
fired 0
by 0
police 0
chiefs. 0

This 0
includes 0
cops 0
within 0
the 0
Dallas 0
police 0
department. 0

Amy 0
Wilburn, 0
a 0
former 0
Dallas 1
cop 1
shot 1
an 1
unarmed 1
teen 1
in 0
the 0
stomach 0
as 0
he 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
his 0
hands 0
in 0
the 0
air 0
in 0
2013. 0

Days 0
later, 0
after 0
her 0
account 0
was 0
found 0
to 0
be 0
entirely 0
false, 0
she 0
was 0
fired 0
for 0
it. 0

Wilburn 0
became 0
the 0
first 0
cop 0
in 0
41 0
years 0
since 0
officer 1
Darrell 1
Cain 1
murdered 1
a 1
12 1
year 1
old 1
boy 1
in 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
his 0
squad 0
car 0
to 0
be 0
indicted 0
for 0
shooting 0
a 0
suspect. 0

Also 0
in 0
2013, 0
officer 1
Cardan 1
Spencer 1
shot 1
a 1
mentally 1
ill 1
man 1
in 0
his 0
driveway. 0

Days 0
later, 0
he 0
was 0
also 0
fired 0
after 0
surveillance 0
video 0
proved 0
he 0
was 0
lying 0
about 0
what 0
happened. 0

So 0
why 0
hasn’t 0
the 0
chief 0
fired 0
Gugyer, 0
who 0
has 0
actually 0
been 0
charged, 0
arrested, 0
and 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man? 0

Like 0
all 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
a 0
crime, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
deserves 0
her 0
day 0
in 0
court. 0

However, 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
her 0
job 0
with 0
the 0
department 0
is 0
concerned, 0
she 0
has 0
already 0
proven 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
fit 0
for 0
duty, 0
ever 0
again. 0

WFAA 0
asked 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
for 0
the 0
laws 0
she 0
cited 0
claiming 0
that 0
she 0
can’t 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
but 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
them. 0

The 0
department 0
did 0
respond 0
about 0
the 0
general 0
order 0
mentioned 0
by 0
WFAA, 0
however, 0
saying, 0
“General 0
order 0
508 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Police 0
Chief’s 0
ability 0
to 0
circumvent 0
the 0
formal 0
disciplinary 0
procedures 0
not 0
the 0
investigative 0
process.” 0

Exactly 0
what 0
“investigative 0
process” 0
needs 0
to 0
happen 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
fire 0
her 0
remains 0
unclear 0
as 0
this 0
public 0
servant 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
in 0
his 0
own 0
home. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
she 0
should 0
be 0
fired 0
for 0
this. 0

But 0
then 0
again, 0
as 0
we’ve 0
reported 0
already 0
this 0
week, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
is 0
subject 0
to 0
a 0
different 0
set 0
of 0
rules 0
than 0
common 0
citizens, 0
which 0
apparently 0
includes 0
keeping 0
a 0
paycheck 0
after 0
admitting 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
unarmed, 0
innocent, 1
pillar 1
of 1
society, 1
Botham 0
Jean. 0

Couple 0
question 0
why 1
police 1
waited 1
so 1
long 1
to 1
search 1
New 1
Mexico 1
compound 1

(CNN) 0
A 0
New 0
Mexico 0
couple 0
told 0
authorities 0
months 0
ago 0
they 0
thought 0
a 0
missing 0
Georgia 0
boy 0
and 0
his 1
fugitive 1
father 1
were 0
living 0
in 0
a 1
filthy 1
compound 1
on 0
their 0
property. 0

But 0
police 0
did 0
not 0
carry 0
out 0
a 0
search 0
of 0
the 0
property 0
until 0
last 0
week, 0
Taos 0
County 0
Sheriff 0
Jerry 0
Hogrefe 0
said, 0
because 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
believe 0
they 0
had 0
probable 0
cause 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

That 0
delay 0
is 0
facing 0
scrutiny 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
Monday's 0
discovery 0
of 0
a 0
young 0
boy's 0
remains 0
at 0
the 0
compound. 0

"They 1
were 1
dragging 1
their 1
feet. 1

They 1
were 1
taking 1
too 1
long," 1
said 0
Tanya 0
Badger, 0
who 0
with 0
her 0
husband, 0
Jason, 0
told 0
authorities 0
about 0
the 0
boy's 0
suspected 0
presence 0
at 0
the 0
compound. 0

"Even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
trying 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
case 1
or 1
whatnot, 1
a 1
child's 1
life 1
is 1
at 1
stake." 1

It's 0
not 0
clear 0
whether 0
the 0
remains 0
are 0
those 0
of 0
Abdul 0
Ghani 0
Wahhaj, 0
a 0
child 0
with 0
severe 0
medical 0
problems 0
who 0
disappeared 0
from 0
Georgia 0
about 0
nine 0
months 0
ago. 0

The 0
remains 0
were 0
discovered 0
in 0
a 1
wretched 1
compound 1
along 0
with 0
11 0
starving 0
children, 0
authorities 0
said. 0

More 0
details 0
about 0
the 1
horrid 1
compound 1
could 0
be 0
revealed 0
Wednesday 0
when 0
the 0
five 0
adults 0
arrested 0
from 0
the 0
site 0
make 0
their 0
first 0
court 0
appearances. 0

Authorities 0
raided 0
the 0
compound 0
in 0
Amalia, 0
New 0
Mexico, 0
on 0
Friday 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
search 0
for 0
Abdul 0
Ghani, 0
whose 0
father, 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
allegedly 0
abducted 0
him 0
from 0
Georgia 0
in 0
November. 0

Neighbors 0
raised 1
alarm 1
about 0
a 0
suspect 0

The 0
Badgers 0
, 0
whose 0
land 0
the 0
compound 0
was 0
on, 0
said 0
they 0
saw 0
a 0
boy 0
they 0
thought 0
was 0
Abdul 0
Ghani 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
February. 0

In 0
April, 0
they 0
discovered 0
the 0
boy 0
was 0
listed 0
as 0
missing 0
and 0
his 0
father 0
a 0
fugitive. 0

They 0
reported 0
the 0
sightings 0
to 0
state 0
and 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
months 0
before 0
police 0
moved 0
in, 0
the 0
couple 0
said. 0

"We 1
are 1
just 1
beyond 1
frustrated 1
that 1
they 1
took 1
so 1
long," 1
Tanya 0
Badger 0
said. 0

New 0
Mexico 0
authorities 0
had 0
suspected 0
the 0
father 0
and 0
son 0
might 0
be 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
after 0
learning 0
about 0
the 0
abduction 0
in 0
May, 0
the 0
sheriff 0
said. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
enough 0
evidence 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant, 0
and 0
surveillance 0
of 0
the 0
property 0
didn't 0
identify 0
the 0
pair 0
there. 0

"I 0
had 0
no 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
go 0
onto 0
this 0
property," 0
Hogrefe 0
said. 0

"In 0
hindsight 0
I 0
wish 0
there 0
was, 0
but 0
we 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
there 0
lawfully." 0

The 0
sheriff 0
said 0
that 0
"they 0
did 0
surveillance, 0
both 0
ground 0
and 0
aerial, 0
and 0
photographs 0
were 0
shared 0
with 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
mother 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
boy. 0

The 0
boy 0
Abdul 0
was 0
never 0
identified 0
from 0
those 0
photos. 0

Moving 0
forward 0
we 0
knew 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
this 0
compound, 0
but 0
we 0
had 0
very 0
little 0
details 0
about 0
it 0
or 0
who 0
was 0
occupying 0
it. 0

These 0
people 0
just 0
kind 0
of 0
(sprang) 1
up 1
very 0
quickly." 0

The 0
authorities' 0
view 0
changed 0
Thursday 0
when 0
they 0
said 0
they 0
received 0
a 0
message 0
about 0
possible 0
starving 0
children 0
living 0
on 0
the 0
compound, 0
and 0
had 0
enough 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
an 0
affidavit 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant. 0

"We 0
are 0
starving 0
and 0
need 0
food 0
and 0
water," 0
the 0
message 0
said, 0
according 0
to 0
authorities. 0

Authorities 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
forwarded 0
to 0
them 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
details 0
on 0
its 0
origin. 0

Compound 1
wasn't 1
searched 1
thoroughly, 1
couple 0
say 0

When 0
officers 0
executed 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
on 0
the 0
compound, 0
they 0
found 0
a 1
horrifying 1
scene. 1

Stacks 0
of 0
tires, 0
piles 0
of 0
trash 0
and 0
plastic 0
sheets 0
surrounded 0
the 0
compound. 0

Obscured 0
by 0
the 0
junk 0
was 0
a 0
trailer 0
where 0
the 0
11 0
children 0
and 0
five 0
adults 0
were 0
living. 0

The 0
children 0
wore 0
dirty 1
rags 1
for 0
clothing 0
with 0
no 0
shoes, 0
and 0
were 0
surrounded 0
by 0
weapons 0
and 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammunition, 0
authorities 0
said. 0

"It 1
was 1
the 1
saddest 1
living 1
conditions 1
and 1
poverty 1
I 1
have 1
seen," 1
Hogrefe 0
said. 0

The 0
father 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
boy, 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
was 0
arrested 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
Friday 0
along 0
with 0
his 0
sisters 0
Hujrah 0
Wahhaj 0
and 0
Subhannah 0
Wahhaj 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
adults 0
Lucas 0
Morten 0
and 0
Jany 0
Leveille. 0

All 0
have 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
abuse 0
of 0
the 0
11 0
children. 0

Morten 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
harboring 0
a 0
fugitive. 0

However, 1
the 1
Badgers 1
said 1
that 1
police 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
a 1
thorough 1
job 1
searching 1
the 1
property. 1

The 0
couple 0
said 0
they 0
went 0
back 0
over 0
the 0
weekend 0
after 0
they 0
found 0
out 0
Abdul 0
Ghani 0
wasn't 0
among 0
the 0
11 0
children 0
discovered 0
during 0
the 0
raid. 0

Tanya 0
and 0
Jason 0
Badger 0
said 0
they 0
told 0
authorities 0
they 0
had 0
seen 0
a 0
boy 0
they 0
thought 0
was 0
Abdul 0
Ghani 0
Wahhaj. 0

They 1
said 1
they 1
were 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
not 1
taped 1
off 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
largely 1
untouched. 1

They 1
found 1
two 1
guns, 1
ammo, 1
tactical 1
vests 1
and 1
video 1
cameras 1
that 1
police 1
initially 1
missed, 1
Jason 1
Badger 1
said. 1

"When 1
we 1
first 1
went 1
up 1
there, 1
nothing 1
was 1
overturned," 1
he 1
said. 1

"You 1
could 1
tell 1
nobody 1
had 1
looked 1
underneath 1
that, 1
nobody 1
had 1
looked 1
underneath 1
this." 1

Father 1
allegedly 1
took 1
boy 1
in 1
November 1

Abdul 0
Ghani's 0
mother, 0
Hakima 0
Ramzi, 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
reached 0
after 0
authorities 0
announced 0
the 0
discovery 0
of 0
the 0
remains. 0

But 0
hours 0
earlier, 0
Ramzi 0
told 0
CNN 0
she 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
he'd 0
disappear 0
with 0
their 0
son 0
for 0
nine 0
months, 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
found 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
with 0
11 0
other 0
children 0

"My 0
husband 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
taking 0
Abdul 0
Ghani 0
to 0
the 0
park, 0
and 0
didn't 0
come 0
back. 0

That 0
was 0
in 0
November 0
2017. 0

When 0
I 0
would 0
ask 0
him 0
where 0
he 0
was, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
his 0
way, 0
he 0
was 0
coming 0
soon, 0
he 0
was 0
just 0
keeping 0
him 0
for 0

"wanted 1

he 0
believed 0

But 0
Ramzi 0

"It's 0

That 0

"just 0

there 0
was 0
no 0

another, 0
it 0

will 0

They 0
will 0
be 0
used 0

to 0
fundraise, 0
in 0
violation 0

The 0
three 0
goals 0
of 0
all 0
this 0
are 0
simple. 0

1. 0

Keep 0
the 0

happy 0
and 0
profitable 0

2. 0

Undermine 1
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
prevent 0
him 0
from 0
implementing 0
reforms. 0

3. 0

Punish 0
the 0
voting 0
public 0
for 0
electing 0
Trump 0

Never 0
underestimate 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 1
swamp's 1
spite. 1

Much 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
about 0
self 0
defense. 0

The 0
more 0
Trump 0
is 0
investigated, 0
the 0
less 0
he 0
can 0
investigate, 0
reform 0
or 0
implement 0
changes 0
to 0
the 0
swamp. 1

But 0
plenty 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
about 0
malice 1
and 1
spite. 1

Culture 0
wars 0
are 0
built 0
on 0
tribal 1
rage. 1

That's 0
what 0

about. 0

the 0

Fifth 0

to 0

without 0

or 0
a 0
chance 0

Kelly 0
said 0
White 0
House 0
officials 0
couldn’t 0
say 0
who 0
made 0
the 0
decision 0
or 0
how. 0

The 0

ordered 0
the 0

to 0
restore 0
the 0
credential 0
while 0
the 0
rest 0

“This 0

Acosta’s 0

that 0

Kelly 0
said 0
he 0
hasn’t 0
considered 0
at 0
all 0
yet 0
whether 0
the 0

violated 0

More 0

are 0
expected 0
Tuesday. 0

“I 0
trust 0
this 0

will 0
continue 0
at 0
a 0
rapid 0
pace.” 0
Kelly 0
said. 0

What? 0

Due 0
process? 0

Wait, 0
Acosta 0
was 0
not 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
crime. 0

Neither 0
his 0

You 0

that 0

“I 0

Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0

issued 0
a 0
statement 0
following 0
the 0
judge's 0
ruling 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

“Today, 0
the 0

that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
court, 0
we 0
will 0
temporarily 0
reinstate 0
the 0

Well, 0
I 0
can't 0
wait 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
next 0

Perhaps 0
there 0
is 0
an 0
easier 0
way 0
around 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

from 0

at 0
the 0
Education 0
Minnesota 0
Apple 0
Valley 0
open 0
to 0
union 0
members 0
and 0

Prior 0
to 0
the 0
event, 0
Ellison's 0
campaign 0
called 0
police 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
"protected" 0
from 0
a 0
woman 0
armed 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
camera 0
phone 0
. 0

Loomer 0
peppered 0
him 0
with 0
questions 0
about 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
at 0
a 0
State 0
Attorney 0
General 0
debate 0
Friday 0
night. 0

She 0
stood 0
alongside 0
other 0
female 0
survivors 0
of 0
abuse. 0

Ellison 0
not 0
only 0
claimed 0
the 0
women 0
were 0
lying 0
but 0
then 0
fled 0
the 0
scene. 0

At 0
least 0
he 0
said 0
something 0
there, 0
which 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
for 0
his 0
response 0
earlier 0
in 0
September 0
when 0
Loomer 0
confronted 0
him 0
at 0
another 0
event 0
with 0
questions. 0

Failing 0
to 0
answer, 0
Ellison 0
tried 0
to 0
move 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person, 0
allowing 0
his 0
minions 1
to 0
try 0
and 0
provide 0
cover 0
for 0
him, 0
similar 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
Maxine 0
Waters, 0
but 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
"member's 0
only" 0
elevator 0
to 0
flee 0
into. 0

Finally, 0
Ellison 0
fled 0
the 0
scene, 0
hounding 0
by 0
Loomer 0
and 0
others 0
questioning 0
him 0
about 0
the 0
abuse. 0

The 0
irony 0
is 0
of 0
Ellison's 0
campaign 0
calling 0
on 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
from 0
a 0
woman, 0
armed 0
with 0
a 0

who 0
is 0
simply 0
asking 0
him 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
the 0
accusations 0
and 0
police 0
report, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
how 0
he 0
plans 0
on 0
being 0
attorney 0
general 0
without 0
a 0
license, 0
when 0
he 0
has 0
shown 0
his 0
support 0
for 0
those 0
that 0
murder 0
police 0
officers 0

cold 0

presented 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
critic 0
of 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam. 0

This 0
past 0
June, 0
Ellison 0
told 0
Jake 0
Tapper 0
on 0
CNN, 0
“I 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
Million 0
Man 0
March 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
proud 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

That’s 0
it.” 0
But 0
that 0
wasn’t 0
it. 0

Ellison 0
first 0
sought 0
office 0
as 0
a 0
Democrat 0
in 0
1998 0
as 0
Keith 0
Ellison 0
Muhammad, 0
a 0
self 0
avowed 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam. 0

(Ellison 0
Muhammad 0
is 0
just 0
one 0
of 0
three 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
names 0
Ellison 0
has 0
used 0
over 0
the 0
years.) 0

Fortunately 0
for 0
him, 0
Ellison’s 0
5th 0
District 0
constituents 0
haven’t 0
much 0
cared 0
about 0
his 0
history 0
and 0
the 0
Minneapolis 0
Star 0
Tribune 0
has 0
almost 0
entirely 0
let 0
it 0
rest 0
exactly 0
where 0
Ellison 0
wants 0
it. 0

But 0
seeking 0
the 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
job 0
in 0
Minnesota 0
and 0
running 0
for 0
statewide 0
office 0
should 0
be 0
a 0
more 0
daunting 0
challenge 0
because 0
Ellison 0
is 0
an 0
extraordinarily 1
poor 1
fit 1
for 0
the 0
job. 0

Among 0
the 0
troubling 0
threads 0
that 0
run 0
through 0
Ellison’s 0
career: 0
support 0
for 0
cop 1
killers. 1

In 0
September 0
1992 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
officer 0
Jerry 0
Haaf 0
was 0
murdered 1
execution 1
style, 1
shot 0
in 0
the 0
back 0
as 0
he 0
took 0
a 0
coffee 0
break 0
at 0
a 0
restaurant 0
in 0
south 0
Minneapolis. 0

Police 0
later 0
determined 0
that 0
Haaf’s 0
murder 0
was 0
a 0
gang 0
hit 0
performed 0
by 0
four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
city’s 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
gang.The 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
was 0
Sharif 0
Willis, 0
a 0
convicted 0
murderer 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
released 0
from 0
prison 0
and 0
who 0
sought 0
respectability 0
as 0
a 0
responsible 0
gang 0
leader 0
from 0
gullible 0
municipal 0
authorities 0
while 0
operating 0
a 0
gang 0
front 0
called 0
United 0
for 0
Peace. 0

The 0
four 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
members 0
who 0
murdered 0
Haaf 0
met 0
and 0
planned 0
the 0
murder 0
at 0
Willis’s 0
house. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
two 0
witnesses 0
implicated 0
Willis 0
in 0
the 0
planning 0
he 0
was 0
never 0
charged 0
because 0
law 0
enforcement 0
authorities 0
said 0
they 0
lacked 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
convict 0
him. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Ellison 0
was 0
a 0
Minneapolis 0
attorney 0
in 0
private 0
practice. 0

And 0
within 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
Haaf’s 0
murder, 0
Ellison 0
appeared 0
with 0
Willis 0
supporting 0
the 0
United 0
for 0
Peace 0
gang 0
front. 0

In 0
October 0
1992, 0
Ellison 0
helped 0
organize 0
a 0
demonstration 0
against 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
that 0
included 0
United 0
for 0
Peace. 0

“The 0
main 0
point 0
of 0
our 0
rally 0
is 0
to 0
support 0
United 0
for 0
Peace 0
[in 0
its 0
fight 0
against] 0
the 0
campaign 0
of 0
slander 0
the 0
police 0
federation 0
has 0
been 0
waging,” 0
said 0
Ellison. 0

Willis 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
speaker 0
at 0
the 0
demonstration. 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
contemporaneous 0
report 0
in 0
the 0
St. 0
Paul 0
Pioneer 0
Press, 0
Willis 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
that 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
were 0
experiencing 0
the 0
same 0
fear 0
from 0
young 0
black 0
men 0
that 0
blacks 0
had 0
felt 0
from 0
police 0
for 0
many 0
years. 0

“If 0
the 0
police 0
have 0
some 0
fear, 0
I 0
understand 0
that 0
fear,” 0
Willis 0
said. 0

“We 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
an 0
overabundance 0
of 0
bad 1
police. 0

. 0

. 0

. 0

[W]e’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
them,” 0
Willis 0
said. 0

“They’ve 1
got 1
to 1
go.” 1
The 0
Pioneer 0
Press 0
account 0
concludes 0
with 0
Ellison’s 0
contribution 0
to 0
the 0
demonstration: 0
“Ellison 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
that 0
the 0
police 0
union 0
is 0
systematically 0
frightening 0
whites 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
more 0
police 0
officers 0
hired. 0

That 0
way, 0
Ellison 0
said, 0
the 0
union 0
can 0
increase 0
its 0
power 0
base.” 0
Ellison 0
publicly 0
supported 0
the 0
Haaf 0
murder 0
defendants. 0

In 0
February 0
1993, 0
he 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
demonstration 0
for 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
during 0
his 0
trial. 0

Ellison 0
led 0
the 0
crowd 0
assembled 0
at 0
the 0
courthouse 0
in 0
a 0
chant 0
that 0
was 0
ominous 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
Haaf’s 0
cold 0
blooded 0
murder: 0
“We 1
don’t 1
get 1
no 1
justice, 1
you 1
don’t 1
get 1
no 1
peace.” 1
Ellison’s 0
working 0
relationship 0
with 0
Sharif 0
Willis 0
finally 0
came 0
to 0
an 0
end 0
in 0
February 0
1995, 0
when 0
Willis 0
was 0
convicted 0
in 0
federal 0
court 0
on 0
several 0
counts 0
of 0
drug 0
and 0
gun 0
related 0
crimes 0
and 0
sent 0
back 0
to 0
prison 0
for 0
20 0
years. 0

The 0
Haaf 0
case 0
wasn’t 0
an 0
aberration 0
for 0
Ellison. 0

In 0
February 0
2000, 0
he 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
fundraiser 0
sponsored 0
by 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
chapter 0
of 0
the 0
old 0
National 0
Lawyers 0
Guild, 0
on 0
whose 0
steering 0
committee 0
he 0
had 0
served 0
the 0
chapter 0
was 0
raising 0
funds 0
for 0
former 0
Symbionese 0
Liberation 0
Army 0
member 0
Kathleen 0
Soliah, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
fugitive 0
from 0
justice 0
for 0
25 0
years, 0
on 0
charges 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
attempted 0
pipe 0
bombing 0
of 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
police 0
officers 0
in 0
1975. 0

(The 0
National 0

an 0

Soviet 0
Union. 0

and 0
go; 0
dupes 1
are 0

In 0
his 0
National 0
Lawyers 0
Guild 0
speech 0
Ellison 0
spoke 0
favorably 0
of 0
cop 1
killers 1
Mumia 0
Abu 0
Jamal 0
and 0
“Assata 0
Shakur” 0
(Joanne 0
Chesimard), 0
who 0
was 0
wanted 0
for 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
New 0
Jersey 0
state 0
trooper 0
Werner 0
Foerster 0
in 0
1973. 0

Chesimard 0
was 0
convicted 0
of 0
that 0
murder 0
but 0
escaped 0
from 0
prison 0
in 0
1979 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
the 0
lam 0
in 0
Cuba 0
since 0
1984. 0

Bryan 0
Burrough’s 0
Days 0
of 0
Rage 0
has 0
a 0
riveting 0
account 0
of 0
Chesimard’s 0
terrorist 0
career. 0

In 0
2013, 0
the 0
FBI 0
made 0
Chesimard 0
the 0
first 0
woman 0
named 0
to 0
its 0
Most 0
Wanted 0
Terrorists 0
List. 0

The 0
FBI 0
has 0
offered 0
a 0
reward 0
of 0
up 0
to 0
$1,000,000 0
for 0
her 0
capture. 0

Yet 0
Ellison 0
prayed 0
for 0
Chesimard 0
in 0
his 0
National 0
Lawyers 0
Guild 0
speech: 0
“I 0
am 0
praying 0
that 0
Castro 0
does 0
not 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
where 0
he 0
has 0
to 0
really 0
barter 0
with 0
these 0
guys 0
over 0
here 0
because 0
they’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
Assata 0
Shakur, 0
they’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
other 0
people,” 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
crowd. 0

“I 0
hope 0
the 0
Cuba[n] 0
people 0
can 0
stick 0
to 0
it, 0
because 0
the 0
freedom 0
of 0
some 0
good 0
decent 0
people 0
depends 0
on 0
it.” 0
Ellison’s 0
support 0
for 0
Soliah/Olson 0
in 0
the 0
speech 0
is 0
equally 0
notable. 0

He 0
denounced 0
law 0
enforcement 0
authorities 0
for 0
prosecuting 0
the 0
attempted 0
murder 0
of 0
police 0
officers. 0

Referring 0
to 0
the 0
days 0
Soliah/Olson 0
had 0
spent 0
in 0
the 0
SLA 0
under 0
the 0
leadership 0
of 0
Donald 0
DeFreeze 0
(“Field 0
Marshal 0
Cinque”), 0
Ellison 0
hailed 0
Soliah/Olson 0
as 0
a 0
“black 1
gang 1
member” 1
and 0
portrayed 0
her 0
as 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
government 0
persecution. 0

He 0
described 0
her 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
“fighting 0
for 0
freedom 0
in 0
the 0
‘60s 0
and’70s” 0
and 0
called 0
for 0
her 0
release. 0

Ellison 0
to 0
the 0
contrary 0
notwithstanding, 0
Soliah/Olson 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
the 0
crimes 0
charged 0
in 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
and 0
to 0
an 0
additional 0
murder 0
charge 0
in 0
Sacramento. 0

According 0
to 0
Ellison, 0
Soliah/Olson 0
was 0
a 0
social 0
justice 0
warrior 0
fighting 0
the 0
good 0
fight. 0

The 0
case 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
attempted 0
murder 0
of 0
police 0
officers; 0
that 0
was 0
but 0
a 0
pretext. 0

Seems 0
he 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
willing 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
shield 0
him 0
from 0
the 0
press 0
who 0
will 0
confront 0
him 0
publicly 0
while 0
taking 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
their 0
murderers 0
for 0
political 0
gain. 0

From 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
this 0
case, 0
it 0
was 0
clear 0
that 0
Guyger 0
was 0
receiving 0
special 0
treatment 0
from 0
law 0
enforcement. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
glaring 1
instances 0
showing 0
her 0
privilege 0
was 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Texas 0
Rangers 0
said 0
in 0
their 0
report 0
that 0
Jean 0
refused 0
to 0
obey 0
Guyger’s 0
“verbal 0
commands.” 0
Had 0
anyone 0
else 0
but 0
a 0
cop 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
and 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man, 0
do 0
you 0
believe 0
that 0
investigators 0
would 0
have 0
said 0
anything 0
like 0
this? 0

Attorney 0
Stephen 0
Le 0
Brocq, 0
who 0
operates 0
a 0
law 0
firm 0
in 0
the 0
North 0
Texas 0
area 0
sums 0
up 0
the 0
treatment 0
of 0
Guyger 0
perfectly 0
when 0
he 0
says 0
that 0
“The 0
affidavit 0
isn’t 0
written 0
objectively, 0
not 0
at 0
the 0
slightest. 0

As 0
stated 0
before, 0
they 0
are 0
usually 0
wholly 0
against 0
the 0
accused. 0

An 0
objective 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
related 0
by 0
the 0
officer 0
would 0
be 0
proper, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion. 0

This 0
affidavit 0
states 0
facts 0
based 0
upon 0
the 0
word 0
of 0
the 0
person 0
it 0
seeks 0
to 0
accuse 0
of 0
criminal 0
wrongdoing.” 0

What’s 0
more, 0
according 0
to 0
WFAA, 0
who 0
obtained 0
affidavits 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
search 0
warrants 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
case, 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
involved 0
the 0
search 0
of 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
don’t 0
recall, 0
police 0
egregiously 1
released 0
the 0
search 0
warrant 0
findings 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
his 0
family 0
buried 0
his 0
dead 0
body. 0

They 0
attempted 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Jean’s 0
character 0
by 0
claiming 0
they 0
found 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
half 0
ounce 0
of 0
weed 0
in 0
his 0
apartment. 0

However, 0
they 0
failed 0
miserably 1
at 0
it. 0

One 0
thing 0
in 0
particular, 0
however, 0
stood 0
out 0
to 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
the 0
police 0
didn’t 0
release 0
any 0
information 0
on 0
what 0
they 0
found 0
in 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
information 0
currently 0
available, 0
that’s 0
because 0
they 0
didn’t 0
search 0
it. 0

According 0
to 0
WFAA, 0
there 0
were 0
five 0
search 0
warrants 0
issued 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
none 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
for 0
the 0
killer’s 0
apartment. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
reports: 0

Two 0
of 0
the 0

allowed 0

their 0

of 0

and 0
downloaded 0
the 0
data 0
from 0
the 0
door 0

A 0
third 0

warrant 0
gave 0
investigators 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
enter 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
and 0
collect 0
additional 0

A 0

Now, 0
even 0
if 0
police 0
would 0
try 0
to 0
search 0
the 0
killer 1
cop’s 1
apartment, 0
it’s 0
too 0
late. 0

On 0
Sunday, 0
apartment 0
staff 0
notified 0
residents 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
that 0
Guyger 0
“has 0
vacated 0
her 0

and 0
no 0
longer 0

at 0

community.” 1

A 0
manager 0
at 0
the 0
complex 0
declined 0
to 0
indicate 0
exactly 0
when 0
Guyger 0
moved 0
out 0
and 0
if 0

Karen 0
Monahan, 0
that 0
Ellison 0
domestically 0

her 0

her 0

“This 0

She 0
has 0
declined 0
to 0

saying 0
it 0
is 0

She 0
also 0
told 0

she 0
misplaced 0
it. 0

Monahan 0
also 0
recently 0
released 0

that 0
she 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
an 0

Ken 0
Martin, 0
the 0
chairman 0
of 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
DFL, 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
the 0
party’s 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
allegations 0
against 0
Ellison 0
will 0
be 0
finished 0
soon, 0
then 0
released 0
to 0
the 0
public. 0

An 0
external 0
investigator 0
was 0
hired 0
to 0
conduct 0
the 0
inquiry. 0

The 0
Star 0
Tribune 0
argued 0
that, 0
given 0
the 0
public 0
interest 0
around 0
that 0
situation 0
and 0
Kim 0
Ellison’s 0
public 0
support 0
of 0
her 0
ex 0
husband, 0
the 0
divorce 0
records 0
are 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
concern 0
to 0
voters. 0

Divorce 0
records 0
are 0
typically 0
public, 0
but 0
judges 0
will 0
often 0
agree 0
to 0
seal 0
them 0
if 0
both 0
parties 0
to 0
the 0
case 0
agree 0
and 0
no 0
one 0
else 0
objects. 0

The 0
Ellison 0
campaign 0
released 0
a 0
statement 0
from 0
Kim 0
Ellison 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
both 0
her 0
and 0
Keith 0
Ellison. 0

“Our 0
divorce 0
simply 0
isn’t 0
the 0
public’s 0
business, 0
and 0
therefore, 0
when 0
we 0
separated, 0
we 0
jointly 0
asked 0
the 0
court 0
to 0
seal 0
the 0
file. 0

Now, 0
one 0
month 0
before 0
a 0
closely 0
contested 0
election 0
for 0
Minnesota 0
Attorney 0
General, 0
a 0
conservative 0
group 0
wants 0
to 0
probe 0
our 0
divorce 0
file 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
something 0
to 0
use 0
against 0
Keith 0
in 0
this 0
race. 0

I 0
am 0
disappointed 0
that 0
the 0
Star 0

would 0
choose 0
to 0
file 0
this 0
motion.” 0

Trump 0
Vows 0

correspondent 0
Jim 0
Acosta’s 0
“hard 0
pass” 0
media 0
credential 0
for 0
the 0
executive 0

in 0

vowing 0

kick 0
Acosta 0
out 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
if 0
he 0
breaches 0
White 0
House 0
protocol 0
again. 0

The 0
yanking 0
of 0
the 0
physical 0
credential, 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
isn’t 0
exactly 0
a 0
grave 1
hardship. 1

It 0
just 0
means 0
Acosta 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
an 0
appointment 0
through 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
office 0
every 0
time 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
grounds, 0
just 0
as 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
non 0
hard 0
pass 0
holding 0
journalists 0
who 0
don’t 0
work 0
for 0
big 0
media 0
outlets 0
like 0
CNN 0
have 0
to 0
do. 0

Lacking 0
a 0
hard 0
pass 0
does 0
not 0
prevent 0
anyone 0
from 0
reporting 0
on 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Speaking 0
to 0
Chris 0
Wallace 0
of 0
Fox 0
News 0
Channel 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Sunday, 0
Trump 0
had 0
some 0
new 0
ideas 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
Acosta, 0
who 0
picks 0
fights 0
with 0
him 0
during 0
pressers. 0

"I 0
think 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
we’ll 0
do 0
is 0
maybe 0
turn 0
the 0
camera 0
off 0
that 0
faces 0
them, 0
because 0
then 0
they 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
air 0
time, 0
although 0
I’ll 0
probably 0
be 0
sued 0
for 0
that 0
and 0
maybe, 0
you 0
know, 0
win 0
or 0
lose 0
it, 0
who 0
knows," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"I 0
mean, 0
with 0
this 0
stuff 0
you 0
never 0
know 0
what’s 0
going 0
to 0
happen." 0

The 0
president 0
described 0
Acosta 0
as 0
"unbelievably 1
rude 1
to 0
[White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary] 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee, 0
who’s 0
a 0
wonderful 1
woman," 1
and 0
said 0
his 0
administration 0
is 0
drawing 0
up 0
"rules 0
and 0
regulations" 0
for 0
White 0
House 0
reporters. 0

"And 0
if 1
he 1
misbehaves, 1
we’ll 1
throw 1
him 1
out 1
or 1
we’ll 1
stop 1
the 1
news 1
conference," 1
Trump 0
said. 0

Acosta’s 0
hard 0
pass 0
was 0
pulled 0
after 0
a 0
contentious 0
Nov. 0
7 0
press 0
conference 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

After 0
interacting 0
with 0
President 0
Trump 0
– 0
Acosta 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
“challenge” 0
him 0
on 0
calling 0
the 0
Central 0
American 0
caravans 0
an 0
“invasion” 1
– 0
the 0
president 0
called 0
upon 0
another 0
reporter 0
to 0
speak. 0

After 0
lecturing 0
Trump, 0
Acosta 0
belligerently 1
refused 0
to 0
yield 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
staffer 0
and 0
pushed 0
her 0
arm 0
away 0

On 0
Nov. 0
16, 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Judge 0
Timothy 0
J. 0
Kelly 0
of 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
by 0
Trump, 0
ruled 0
against 0
the 0
administration 0
and 0
ordered 0
Acosta’s 0
hard 0
pass 0
restored 0
for 0
14 0
days, 0
pending 0
further 0
hearings 0
in 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

But 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
vindication 0
of 0
Acosta’s 0
free 0
speech 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

The 0
judge 0
specifically 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
claim 0
made 0
by 0
Acosta 0
and 0
CNN 0
had 0
not 0
yet 0
been 0
adjudicated 0
and 0
added 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
free 0
not 0
to 0
call 0
on 0
Acosta 0
at 0
future 0
press 0
conferences. 0

The 0
temporary 0
restraining 0
order 0
was 0
nowhere 0
to 0
be 0
found 0
online 0
at 0
press 0
time, 0
but 0
according 0
to 0
media 0
reports, 0
Kelly 0
found 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
violated 0
Acosta’s 0
due 0
process 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
to 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
vowed 0
to 0
remedy 0
the 0
situation 0
by 0
drawing 0
up 0
rules 0
governing 0
press 0
conferences. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
said 0
the 0
court 0
ruling 0
was 0
disappointing. 1

“The 0
President 0
has 0
broad 0
authority 0
to 0
regulate 0
access 0

House, 0
including 0
to 0
ensure 0
fair 0

We 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
continuing 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
lawful 1
actions." 0

Acosta 0
ignorantly 1
blathered 1
on 0
to 0
reporters 0
when 0
he 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Friday 0
after 0
the 0
court 0
ruling, 0
incorrectly 0
claiming 0
he 0
won 0
a 1
great 1
First 1
Amendment 1
victory. 1

"I'm 0
very 0
grateful 0
for 0
what 0
happened 0
today," 0
Acosta 0
said. 0

"I'm 0
grateful 0
for 0
my 0
colleagues 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
who 0
stood 0
by 0
us 0
through 0
all 0
of 0
this." 0

"This 0
was 0
a 0
test 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
we 0
passed 0
the 0
test," 0
he 0
said. 0

"Journalists 0
need 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
their 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
of 0
freedom 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
are 0
sacred, 0
they're 0
protected 0
in 0
our 1
Constitution," 1
Acosta 0
said. 0

"Throughout 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
I 0
was 0
confident 0
and 0
I 0
thought 0
that 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
result 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0

that 0
our 0

protected 0
as 0
we 0
continue 0
to 0

The 0
court 0
case 0
isn’t 0
over 0
yet. 0

The 0
legal 0
antagonists 0
have 0
to 0
report 0
to 0
the 0

Monday 0
afternoon. 0

The 0

According 0
to 0

“White 0

(The 0

Not’ 0

Apology 0

Former 0
president 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
has 0
spoken 0
out 0
about 0
what 0
happened 0
during 0
his 0
affair 0
with 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
intern 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky. 0

Among 0
other 0
things, 0
Clinton 0
says 0
Lewinsky 0
is 0
not 0
owed 0
an 0
apology 0
from 0
him 0
and 0
he 0
“did 0
the 0
right 0
thing.” 0

As 0
reported 0
by 0
CNN, 0
Speaking 0
to 0
Today, 0
Clinton 0
defended 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
office 0
following 0
the 0
scandal. 0

“A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
have 0
been 0
conveniently 0
omitted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
story 0
work, 0
I 0
think 0
partly 0
because 0
they’re 0
frustrated 0
that 0
they 0
got 0
all 0
these 0
serious 0
allegations 0
against 0
the 0
current 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office 0
and 0
his 0
voters 0
don’t 0
seem 0
to 0
care,” 0
Clinton 0
said, 0
pointing 0
to 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
sexual 1
misconduct 1
allegations 0
against 0
current 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
who 0
has 0
denied 0
them. 0

“I 0
think 0
I 0
did 0
the 0
right 0
thing. 0

I 0
defended 0
the 0
Constitution.” 0

In 0
an 0
essay 0
for 0
Vanity 0
Fair 0
published 0
earlier 0
this 0
year, 0
Lewinsky 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
questioning 0
the 0
narrative 0
surrounding 0
the 0
affair, 0
which 0
played 0
a 0
central 0
role 0
in 0
Clinton’s 0
eventual 0
impeachment. 0

“Now, 0
at 0
44, 0
I’m 0
beginning 0
(just 0
beginning) 0
to 0
consider 0
the 0
implications 0
of 0
power 0
differentials 0
that 0
were 0
so 0
vast 0
between 0
a 0
president 0
and 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
intern,” 0
she 0
wrote. 0

“I’m 0
beginning 0
to 0
entertain 0
the 0
notion 0
that 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
circumstance 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
consent 0
might 0
well 0
be 0
rendered 0
moot.” 0

When 0
asked 0
if 0
he 0
owed 0
Lewinsky 0
an 0
apology, 0
President 0
Clinton 0
told 0
NBC‘s 0
Craig 0
Melvin, 0
“No, 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
talked 0
to 0
her. 0

But 0
I 0
did 0
say 0
publicly 0
on 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
occasion 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
sorry. 0

That’s 0
very 0
different. 0

The 0
apology 0
was 0
public.” 0
Although 0
some 0
may 0
not 0
have 0
taken 0
what 0
Clinton 0
said 0
as 0
an 0
apology, 0
he 0
did 0
publicly 0
acknowledge 0
at 0
the 0
National 0
Prayer 0
Breakfast 0
in 0
1998 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
“sinned.” 0

“I 0
don’t 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
fancy 0
way 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
sinned. 0

It 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
everybody 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
hurt 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
sorrow 0
I 0
feel 0
is 0
genuine 0

Judge 0

granted 0

Tuesday 0
to 0
take 0
the 0

The 0

last 0

gave 0
permission 0
for 0
Wilson 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0

but 0
the 0
White 0

said 0
Wednesday 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
unaware 0
of 0
the 0
decision 0
and 0
was 0
glad 0
it 0
was 0
being 0
reviewed. 0

Eight 0
US 0

and 0
the 0
District 0
of 0

sued, 0
arguing 0
the 0
blueprints 0
could 0
allow 0
anyone 0
from 0

to 0
a 0
'lone 0
wolf' 0
gunman 0
to 0
make 0
untraceable, 1

Wilson 0
complied 0
with 0
the 0

put 0
out 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
financial 0

for 0
the 0
legal 0
battle 0
ahead, 0
including 0
a 0
scheduled 0
August 0

He 0
told 0
CBS 0

ahead 0
of 0
the 0
injunction 0
that 0
he 0
believes 0
"access 0
to 0
firearms 0
is 0
a 0
fundamental 0
human 0
dignity. 0

It's 0
a 0
fundamental 0
human 0
right." 0

"What 0
I'm 0
doing 0
is 0
legally 0
protected," 0
he 0
said. 0

"I 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
appellate 0

I 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

I 0
will 0
waste 0
all 0
my 0
time." 0

President 0
'glad' 0
for 0
review 0

As 0
uproar 0
was 0
building 0
Tuesday 0
over 0
Wilson's 0
efforts, 0
the 0
president 0
tweeted 0
that 0
making 0
plastic 0
3D 0
printed 0
guns 0
publicly 0
available 0
"doesn't 0
seem 0
to 0
make 0
much 0
sense." 0

White 0
House 0
spokeswoman 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
elaborated 0
Wednesday, 0
saying 0
the 0
administration's 0
Justice 0
Department 0
had 0
acted 0
on 0
its 0
own 0
in 0
granting 0
Wilson 0
permission 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
blueprints 0
on 0
his 0
Defcad 0
website 0
settling 0
a 0
five 0
year 0
legal 0
battle. 0

"The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
made 0
a 0
deal 0
without 0
the 0
president's 0
approval," 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

"The 0
president's 0
glad 0
this 0
effort 0
was 0
delayed 0
to 0
give 0
more 0
time 0
to 0
review 0
the 0
issue." 0

Sanders 0
also 0
repeated 0
the 0
administration's 0
claim 0
from 0
a 0
day 0
earlier 0
that 0
existing 0
law 0
already 0
prohibits 0
plastic 0
firearms. 0

The 0
National 0
Rifle 0
Association, 0
the 0
nation's 0
most 0
politically 0
influential 0
gun 0
rights 0
group, 0
echoed 0
that 0
claim, 0
contending 0
that 0
the 0
1988 0
law 0
made 0
the 0
current 0
3D 0
printed 0
gun 0
issue 0
moot. 0

"Regardless 0
of 0
what 0
a 0
person 0
may 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
publish 0
on 0
the 0
Internet, 0
undetectable 0
plastic 0
guns 0
have 0
been 0
illegal 0
for 0
30 0
years," 0
the 0
NRA 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

But 0
Wilson 0
has 0
gotten 0
around 0
the 0
legal 0
prohibition 0
by 0
providing 0
instructions 0
with 0
the 0
digital 0
files 0
for 0
3D 0
printing 0
his 0
"Liberator" 0
plastic 0
gun 0
that 0
call 0
for 0
an 0
approximately 0
six 0
ounce 0
block 0
of 0
steel 0
to 0
be 0
affixed 0
to 0
the 0
weapon. 0

Should 0
those 0
who 0
print 0
the 0
gun 0
follow 0
those 0
instructions, 0
metal 0
detectors 0
would 0
pick 0
up 0
the 0
weapons, 0
thus 0
complying 0
with 0
the 0
law. 0

But 0
while 0
users 0
can 0
build 0
the 0
gun, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
to 0
ensure 0
they 0
affix 0
metal 0
to 0
it. 0

'The 0
debate 0

over' 0

Late 0
Tuesday, 0
dozens 0
of 0
Democratic 0
senators 0
introduced 0
legislation 0
to 0
prohibit 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0

designs, 0
a 0
move 0
gun 0
control 0
groups 0
applauded. 0

But 0
some 0
damage 0
was 0
already 0
done. 0

Wilson's 0
blueprints 0
had 0
been 0
posted 0
on 0
Defcad 0
before 0
the 0
court 0
order 0
took 0
effect 0
and 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
downloaded 0
thousands 0

"The 0

are 0
in 0

you 0

Wilson 0
told 0
CBS. 0

Gun 0

groups 0
nevertheless 0
were 0
relieved 0
by 0
the 0

with 0
the 0
Brady 0

"There 0

He 0
also 0
sought 0
to 0
fight 0
back 0
against 0
criticism 0
in 0
his 1
failure 1
to 1
perform 1
his 1

“Finally, 0
I 0

our 0

should 0

Gallegos 0
said 0

“However, 0
I 0
ask 0
that 0
you 0
be 0
civil 0
and 0
respectful 0
in 0
your 0
criticisms 0
as 0
that 0
is 0
more 0
constructive. 0

Cussing 1
and 1
threatening 1
the 0
people 0
involved 0
will 0
not 0
accomplish 0
justice 0
and 0
serves 0
no 0
useful 0
purpose. 0

Remember, 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
all 0
the 0
facts. 0

That 0
will 0
develop 0
as 0
the 0
cases 0
progress." 0

Yeah, 0
well, 0
that's 1
about 1
as 1
trustworthy 1
as 1
the 1
FBI 1
in 1
this 1
matter. 1

This 0
latest 0
move, 0
while 0
welcome, 0
may 0
only 0
be 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump's 0
vow 0
to 0
"get 0
involved." 0

However, 1
I 1
ask, 1
why 1
were 1
you 1
not 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place, 1
Mr. 1
President? 1

According 1
to 1
the 1
Constitution, 1
you, 1
and 1
you 1
alone, 1
are 1
the 1
sole 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
executive 1
branch, 1
and 1
as 1
such 1
you 1
are 1
where 1
the 1
buck 1
stop 1
in 1
making 1
sure 1
the 1
laws 1
are 1
faithfully 1
executed. 1

So, 0
if 0
Trump 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
fire 0
Sessions, 0
perhaps 1
he 1
should 1
stop 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
get 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
actually 1
put 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
Justice 1
Department 1
as 1
attorney 1
general 1
who 1
will 1
do 1
the 1
job 1
faithfully, 1
and 1
by 1
that, 1
I 1
don't 1
mean 1
Trey 1
Gowdy. 1

I 1
mean 1
someone 1
who 1
is 1
serious 1
about 1
justice, 1
not 1
political 1
grandstanding 1
or 1
covering 1
up 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

Until 0
then, 0
I'll 0
consider 0
this 0
the 0

Hogrefe 0

had 0
conducted 0

of 0
the 0
compound 0
while 0
looking 0

the 0

before 0
he 0
decided 0
Thursday 0
to 0
get 0
a 0

The 0
warrant 0
was 0
immediately 0
obtained 0
after 0
a 0
Georgia 0
investigator 0
forwarded 0
a 0
message 0
in 0

someone 0
at 0
the 0

reportedly 0
told 0
another 0

that 0
people 0
who 0
were 0
living 0

were 0

never 0

Watching 0
the 0
full 0

that 0

was 0
making 0
a 0
sincere 1
effort 0
to 0

the 0

answer 0
three 0
of 0

questions 0
before 0

forcefully 1

away 0
from 0

should 0

Geert 0
Wilders 0
Puts 0
the 0
Political 0
Elites 0
On 0
Notice 0

Geert 0
Wilders 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
massive 0
rally 0
for 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
on 0
Saturday. 0

20,000 0
people 0
came 0
out 0
to 0
call 0
for 0
Tommy’s 0
release, 0
and 0
Wilders 0
took 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
political 0
elites 0
of 0
Britain 0
and 0
continental 0
Europe 0
on 0
notice. 0

“Our 1
governments,” 1
Wilders 0
declared, 0
“sold 0
us 0
out 0
with 0
mass 0
immigration. 0

With 0
Islamization. 0

With 0
open 0
borders. 0

We 0
are 0
almost 0
foreigners 0
in 0
our 0
own 0
lands. 0

And 0
if 0
we 0
complain 0
about 0
it, 0
they 0
call 0
us 0
racists 1
and 1
Islamophobes. 1

But 0
I 0
say, 0
no 1
more! 1

And 0
what 0
do 0
you 0
say? 0

No 1
more! 1

And 0
that’s 0
right: 0
enough 0
is 0
enough. 0

We 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
gagged 0
anymore. 0

No 1
more 1
tyranny.” 1

It 0
was 0
extraordinary 0
that 0
the 0
British 0
authorities 0
allowed 0
Wilders 0
into 0
the 0
country 0
at 0
all. 0

Several 0
years 0
ago 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
country, 0
but 0
although 0
the 0
ban 0
was 0
reversed 0
on 0
appeal, 0
the 0
British 0
government 0
recently 0
banned 0
Martin 0
Sellner, 0
Brittany 0
Pettibone, 0
Lauren 0
Southern 0
and 0
Lutz 0
Bachmann 0
from 0
entering, 0
all 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
opposing 0
jihad 0
terror 0
and 0
Sharia 0
oppression, 0
and 0
thereby 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
authoritarian 0
and 0
unwilling 0
to 0
uphold 0
the 0
freedom 0
of 0
speech 0
than 0
ever 0
– 0
at 0
least 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
criticism 0
of 0
Islam, 0
Muslim 1
rape 1
gangs, 1
and 0
mass 0
Muslim 0
migration. 0

Even 0
worse, 0
the 0
bannings 0
of 0
Sellner, 0
Pettibone, 0
Southern, 0
and 0
Bachmann 0
were 0
just 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
pattern. 0

Pamela 0
Geller 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
Britain 0
in 0
2013, 0
apparently 0
for 0
life, 0
also 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
telling 0
the 1
truth 1
about 1
Islam 1
and 1
jihad. 1

Meanwhile, 0
Britain 0
has 0
a 0
steadily 0
lengthening 0
record 0
of 0
admitting 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
without 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
hesitation. 1

Syed 0
Muzaffar 0
Shah 0
Qadri’s 0
preaching 1
of 1
hatred 1
and 1
jihad 1
violence 1
was 0
so 0
hardline 1
that 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
preaching 0
in 0
Pakistan, 0
but 0
the 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
welcomed 0
him 0
into 0
Britain. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
also 0
admitted 0
Shaykh 0
Hamza 0
Sodagar 0
into 0
the 0
country, 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
said: 0
“If 0
there’s 0
homosexual 0
men, 0
the 0
punishment 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
five 0
things. 0

One 0
– 0
the 0
easiest 0
one 0
maybe 0
– 0
chop 0
their 0
head 0
off, 0
that’s 0
the 0
easiest. 0

Second 0
– 0
burn 0
them 0
to 0
death. 0

Third 0
– 0
throw 0
’em 0
off 0
a 0
cliff. 0

Fourth 0
– 0
tear 0
down 0
a 0
wall 0
on 0
them 0
so 0
they 0
die 0
under 0
that. 0

Fifth 0
– 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
the 0
above.” 0

Theresa 0
May’s 0
relentlessly 1
appeasement 1
minded 1
government 0
also 0
admitted 0
two 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
who 0
had 0
praised 0
the 0
murderer 0
of 0
a 0
foe 0
of 0
Pakistan’s 0
blasphemy 0
laws. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
was 0
welcomed 0
by 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Canterbury. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
UK 0
banned 0
three 0
bishops 0
from 0
areas 0
of 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria 0
where 0
Christians 0
are 0
persecuted 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
country. 0

But 0
now 0
matters 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
a 0
head. 0

Apparently 0
British 0
authorities 0
decided 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
too 0
politically 0
costly 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
bar 0
Wilders 0
again. 0

And 0
so 0
he 0
entered, 0
and 0
spoke, 0
and 0
gave 0
them 0
a 0
strong 0
dose 0
of 0
the 0
reality 1
that 0
they 0
are 0
determined 0
to 0
ignore 0
and 0
deny. 0

Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
in 0
prison 0
today 0
because 0
he 0
violated 0
a 0
court 0
order 0
demanding 0
that 0
he 0
not 0
film 0
videos 0
outside 0
the 0
trials 0
of 0
Muslim 1
rape 1
gangs. 1

Clearly 0
the 1
government’s 1
intent 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
that 1
as 1
few 1
people 1
as 1
possible 1
discovered 1
the 1
truth 1
about 0
its 0
massive, 0
years 0
long 0
cover 0

The 0

itself 0

That 0
heralds 0
the 1
death 1

as 1

free 1
society 1
and 0
the 0
beginning 1

unless 1
this 1
slide 1

figures, 0
whatever 0
criticism 0
they 0
have 0
leveled 0
against 0
Tommy 0

in 0
the 0

exposing 1
themselves 1

Britain 1
into 0
a 0
police 0
state. 0

Wilders 0
addressed 0
this 0
endeavor 0
head 0
on, 0
declaring: 0
“We 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
silenced. 1

We 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
intimidated. 1

And 1
we 1
tell 1
the 1
governments, 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
you. 1

We 1
will 1
never 1
surrender. 1

We 1
will 1
stand 1
strong 1
and 1
do 1
our 1
duty. 1

We 1
will 1
defend 1
our 1
civilization. 1

And 1
we 1
will 1
protect 1
our 1
people.” 1

Wilders 0
added: 0
“And 0
I 0
tell 0
you, 0
to 0
the 0
governments. 0

You 0
can 0
throw 0
us 0
in 0
jail, 0
but 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
defeat 0
us. 0

Because, 0
my 0
friends, 0
for 0
every 0
Tommy 0
whom 0
you 0
imprison, 0
thousands 0
will 0
rise 0
up. 0

So 0
take 1
notice, 1
Theresa 0
May. 0

Take 1
notice, 1
Dutch 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Rutte. 0

Take 1
notice, 1
Mrs. 0
Merkel 0
or 0
President 0
Macron. 0

Take 1
notice: 1
the 1
future 1
is 1
ours 1
and 1
not 1
yours. 1

We 0
will 0
defeat 0
you 0
politically, 0
because 0
we, 0
my 0
friends, 0
we 1
are 1
the 1
people.” 1

If 1
Wilders’ 1
words 1
don’t 1
prove 1
true, 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
because 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
free 1
societies 1
in 1
Britain 1
and 1
Western 1
Europe 1
is 1
truly 1
at 1
hand. 1
