Don't "Blame The Police Officer" Who Admitted Killing Botham Jean?	article788271400.txt	30
Dallas, TX   In a repugnant and outright disrespectful move, Texas Senator Ted Cruz went to bat for Amber Guyger, the cop who admitted to taking the life of the innocent 26 year old pillar of society, Botham Jean.	article788271400.txt	98
During an interview over the weekend, Cruz sat down with FOX 26 who started with the question of what he thought about the tragic killing of Jean by Guyger.	article788271400.txt	312
FOX 26 asked Cruz to respond to his Democratic midterm rival, Beto O’Rourke, who called for officer Guyger to be fired.	article788271400.txt	469
“I think we are all counting on the district attorney, on those in positions of trust and power right now, to do the right thing,” O’Rourke said, implying that, at the very minimum, Amber Guyger should be fired.	article788271400.txt	589
“There has to be a full accounting for how young black men continue to be killed in this country without accountability, without justice, without these full investigations, without respecting their civil rights.	article788271400.txt	801
This cannot continue.”	article788271400.txt	1013

In response, Cruz lashed out at O’Rourke, claiming that he is being too quick to judge.	article788271400.txt	1584
“I wish Beto O’Rourke & Democrats weren’t so quick to always blame the police officer,” Cruz said Saturday during an interview with Houston’s KRIV.	article788271400.txt	1672
“She may have been in the wrong … but I don’t think we should jump to conclusions.”	article788271400.txt	1820
Cruz responds to O'Rourke support for DPD firing Amber Guyger: "I wish Beto O’Rourke & Democrats weren’t so quick to always blame the police officer.	article788271400.txt	1904

Cruz then went on to call the situation a tragedy and said that if a jury of her peers finds she did something wrong then Guyger should suffer the consequences.	article788271400.txt	2238
To be clear, Amber Guyger admitted to doing something wrong.	article788271400.txt	2399
While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him.	article788271400.txt	2460
This is a fact.	article788271400.txt	2568
This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.	article788271400.txt	2584
Because of her actions, this man no longer lives.	article788271400.txt	2658
That, Senator Ted Cruz, is wrong.	article788271400.txt	2708
Mistake or not, she killed an innocent man.	article788271400.txt	2742
She is the only one to blame and yet she is still collecting a paycheck from taxpayers.	article788271400.txt	2786
Calling for Gugyer to be fired is not the same as calling for people to be fired for making stupid Instagram posts or saying stupid things she killed an innocent man.	article788271400.txt	2874
At the very least, she should be fired from her job which gave her the gun to do it.	article788271400.txt	3041
What Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing.	article788271400.txt	3126
They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system.	article788271400.txt	3210
In Cruz’s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn’t her’s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz.	article788271400.txt	3282
But that is not the case at all.	article788271400.txt	3498
Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed?	article788271400.txt	3531
If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident?	article788271400.txt	3627
Of course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO.	article788271400.txt	3811
To shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left.	article788271400.txt	3886
This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong.	article788271400.txt	4010
There is no other way around it, “mistake” or not.	article788271400.txt	4100
From the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line.	article788271400.txt	4151
Amber Guyger’s home was never searched while Jean’s apartment was searched that night.	article788271400.txt	4267
The results of the blood test to test for alcohol or drugs in her system were never released, yet police   on the day his mother buried her son   claimed they found marijuana in his house.	article788271400.txt	4354
It’s been a smear campaign from the beginning and it is this way by design.	article788271400.txt	4543
Amber Guyger took an innocent person’s life, and because people are so blinded by the badge, she is being portrayed as the victim.	article788271400.txt	4619
To those who attempt to claim there is no bias in this horrifically flawed system, if ever there was a case to prove you wrong this is it.	article788271400.txt	4750
A tragedy indeed.	article788271400.txt	4889

Keeping things moving, and I think a lot of us can just shout out, “What are you thinking?” as President Donald Trump brings CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a man that blasted the likes of Edward Snowden for revealing the crimes of our government, to the State Department and installs Gina Haspel in the position of head of the Central Intelligence Agency.	article738447109.txt	268
Trump tweeted out the news on Tuesday.	article738447109.txt	619
“Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.	article738447109.txt	658

  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018	article738447109.txt	1180
The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.	article738447109.txt	1232
Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.	article738447109.txt	1304
Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy.	article738447109.txt	1373
Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president.	article738447109.txt	1624
His voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their “honesty and integrity” and the American people for “acts of kindness,” and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy.	article738447109.txt	1830
But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.	article738447109.txt	2071
Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring “an orderly and smooth transition.” The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: “Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.”	article738447109.txt	2130
﻿	article738447109.txt	2536
CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:	article738447109.txt	2538
On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.	article738447109.txt	2618
He “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added.	article738447109.txt	2719
Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.	article738447109.txt	2834
The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service.	article738447109.txt	2932
Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP.	article738447109.txt	3139
Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.	article738447109.txt	3282
Trump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat “will be much happier now.”	article738447109.txt	3366
While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC.	article738447109.txt	3487
Speaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State.	article738447109.txt	3760
“The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover up.	article738447109.txt	3908
Her name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.	article738447109.txt	3994
Incredible.” Snowden tweeted.	article738447109.txt	4106

“Interesting: The new CIA Director Haspel, who ‘tortured some folks,’ probably can’t travel to the EU to meet other spy chiefs without facing arrest due to an @ECCHRBerlin complaint to Germany’s federal prosecutor,” tweeted Snowden.	article738447109.txt	4436

Glenn Greenwald, author of the above piece at The Intercept wrote, “Haspel, who will be the first woman to lead CIA, didn’t just oversee the Bush CIA’s black site but directly participated in the horrific torture of detainees.	article738447109.txt	5594
She also participated in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.”	article738447109.txt	5821
“This isn’t a radical departure for CIA,” Greenwald added.	article738447109.txt	5907
“After all, Haspel did this under George Tenet.	article738447109.txt	5966
At the time, John Brennan – who became Obama’s CIA director – was an advocate of rendition & other torture methods.	article738447109.txt	6014
And Pompeo was fine with black sites.	article738447109.txt	6130
Still notable: she’s an actual torturer.”	article738447109.txt	6168
From Greenwald’s article:	article738447109.txt	6210

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said at a news conference Saturday that Joering and Morelli were shot immediately upon entering.	article730081389.txt	1034
After the initial hang up call at noon, a dispatcher called the number back and reached a woman who was crying and could be heard saying, ‘‘won’t let me in.’’	article730081389.txt	1170
Officers were then sent to the home.	article730081389.txt	1329
At 12:12 p.m., an officer tells a dispatcher that it’s ‘‘all quiet right now,’’ followed by a door knock.	article730081389.txt	1366
At 12:13 p.m., after a dispatcher confirmed contact has been made, a man’s voice could be heard yelling, ‘‘We have shots fired.’’	article730081389.txt	1472

For immediate releaseAugust 4, 2018Issued by Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe Two males from Georgia are in custody after TCSO... Posted by Taos County Sheriff's Office on Saturday, August 4, 2018	article778094905.txt	1046
The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports on documents they obtained which claims that the adults were training these children to carry out mass shootings in schools.	article778094905.txt	1232
The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly “third world” conditions.	article778094905.txt	1398
Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul Ghani Wahhaj.	article778094905.txt	1581
The documents, which suggest all the adults were involved in the training, say a person serving as a foster parent caring for one of the kids revealed the details about the training.	article778094905.txt	1694

Siraj Wahhaj learned Wednesday that prosecutors want him held without bond, along with his relatives also arrested at the compound: Lucas Allen Morton, Jany Leveille, Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj.	article778094905.txt	2163
Siraj Wahhaj is also accused by Clayton County authorities of abducting his son, Abdul Ghani Wahhaj, in December.	article778094905.txt	2366
Authorities are working to determine if the remains of a young boy found near the compound Monday are Abdul Ghani Wahhaj’s.	article778094905.txt	2480
Monday was (or would’ve been) the child’s 4th birthday.	article778094905.txt	2604

Mueller report: No further indictments	article832908905.txt	0
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s much anticipated final report on his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election has been delivered to Attorney General William Barr.	article832908905.txt	40
A senior Justice Department official said the report does not recommend any further indictments.	article832908905.txt	222
Trump has maintained that he and his campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 campaign.	article832908905.txt	319
His attorneys said Friday he expects the report will exonerate him.	article832908905.txt	419
Barr has said he will write his own account of Mueller’s findings and communicate it to Congress and the American public.	article832908905.txt	487
In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote he “may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.”	article832908905.txt	609
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted Friday afternoon: “The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course.	article832908905.txt	805
The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”	article832908905.txt	976
Barr, in his letter to congressional leaders, said Mueller’s investigation was conducted properly.	article832908905.txt	1059
The attorney general said he was required to inform congressional leaders if Mueller had done anything “inappropriate or unwarranted.”	article832908905.txt	1158
“There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation,” Barr wrote.	article832908905.txt	1293
Trump’s personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, issued a statement.	article832908905.txt	1380
“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations.	article832908905.txt	1457
Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”	article832908905.txt	1585
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz cautioned in an interview with Fox News on Friday afternoon that the report is “a prosecutorial document presenting only one side.”	article832908905.txt	1651
He urged the public “to withhold final judgment until they hear the other side of the story.”	article832908905.txt	1821
Trump: ‘Let people see it’	article832908905.txt	1915
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer released a joint statement insisting Barr release the full report to the public and not give the White House a “sneak preview.”	article832908905.txt	1942
“Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,” they said.	article832908905.txt	2140
“Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any ‘sneak preview’ of Special Counsel Mueller’s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.	article832908905.txt	2364
The Democratic leaders said Mueller’s investigation “focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.”	article832908905.txt	2644
“The American people have a right to the truth.	article832908905.txt	2898

Mueller’s investigation, which began nearly two years ago, has resulted in 200 charges against 34 people and three Russian companies.	article832908905.txt	3117
Six former Trump advisers have been indicted for process crimes, including perjury.	article832908905.txt	3251
However, there have been no indictments related to alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia.	article832908905.txt	3335
Trump has insisted from the beginning that the probe is a “witch hunt.”	article832908905.txt	3432
Rep. Mark Meadows, R N.C., who has investigated Russian interference as a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has been a critic of the Mueller probe.	article832908905.txt	3504

“The Mueller report delivery suggests no more indictments are coming from the Special Counsel.	article832908905.txt	3683

Just minutes after special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his final report on his investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign’s ties to Russia to Attorney General William Barr, Democrats began pressuring the administration to make the findings public.	article832913316.txt	204
In a letter to Congress, Barr said that he could provide lawmakers with a summary of the findings “as soon as this weekend,” but for several of the Democrats seeking to replace Trump in the White House, that wasn’t sufficient.	article832913316.txt	457

Humanity’s WIPEOUT Foreshadowed?	article738028498.txt	0
World Health Chief: Global Pandemic Imminent	article738028498.txt	33
According to a World Health Organization doctor, a global pandemic is imminent, and no one will be prepared for it when it hits.	article738028498.txt	79
Dr. Tedros Adhanom, director general for WHO, has said that the next outbreak that will hit us will be a “terrible” one, causing a large death all over the world.	article738028498.txt	208
“Humanity is more vulnerable in the face of epidemics because we are much more connected and we travel around much more quickly than before,” said WHO specialist in infectious diseases Dr. Sylvie Brand.	article738028498.txt	371
“We know that it is coming, but we have no way of stopping it,” said Brand.	article738028498.txt	574
According to Dr. Tedros, the flu is extremely dangerous to everyone living on the planet.	article738028498.txt	650
This fear was also promoted by experts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month.	article738028498.txt	740
The claims came exactly 100 years after the 1918 Spanish flu that claimed 50 million lives and killed three times as many people as World War I.	article738028498.txt	841
A mutated strain is the most likely contender to wipe out millions because it can join together with other strains to become deadlier.	article738028498.txt	986
“This is not some future nightmare scenario.	article738028498.txt	1121
A devastating epidemic could start in any country at any time and kill millions of people because we are still not prepared.	article738028498.txt	1166
The world remains vulnerable.	article738028498.txt	1291
We do not know where and when the next global pandemic will occur, but we know it will take a terrible toll both on human life and on the economy,” said Dr. Tedros.	article738028498.txt	1321
“Hidden underneath this fear mongering message of a global pandemic is a far more sinister W.H.O.	article738028498.txt	1486
agenda,” warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, publisher of Medicine.news.	article738028498.txt	1584
“The real agenda is a global push for blind, fear based acceptance of unsafe, unproven vaccines that will be rolled out alongside the next global pandemic,” Adams warns.	article738028498.txt	1658
“Fear circumvents rational thinking, which is why the vaccine pharma cartels routinely turn to irrational fear propaganda to demand absolute and unquestioning acceptance of risky medical interventions that should always be scrutinized for safety and efficacy.” –Natural News	article738028498.txt	1828
Dr. Tedros’ comments come on the heels of the plague outbreak in Madagascar, which was the most recent epidemic to receive international aid attention amid fears it would spread.	article738028498.txt	2103
More than 200 people were killed during the outbreak that ravaged the island over the winter, which prompted 10 nearby African countries to be placed on high alert.	article738028498.txt	2282
Dems in Congress Demand Barr Release Full Mueller Report ‘Without Delay’	article832916508.txt	0
Democrats on six House committees including Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D NY), Oversight chair Elijah Cummings (D MD), and Intelligence chair Adam Schiff (D CA) are demanding that the Justice Department release Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report “without delay.” According to the Associated Press, the Democrats said they expect Attorney General William Barr to turn over all the evidence Mueller has collected in his probe into potential Russian collusion in the 2016 election.	article832916508.txt	74
If not, the lawmakers said it “would raise serious questions about whether the Department of Justice policy is being used as a pretext for a cover up of misconduct.” The hashtag “#ReleaseTheReport” was also utilized on Twitter among Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D CA), who warned Barr against giving President Trump or members of his legal team a “sneak preview.”	article832916508.txt	568
Earlier Friday, the AP reported that Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said the president’s lawyers wanted an early look at Mueller’s findings before they were made public.	article832916508.txt	952
Giuliani later disputed that reporting in comments to The Daily Beast, saying the matter “will be handled properly” and it’s “up to DOJ.” The White House had earlier issued a statement saying it was looking “forward” to the next steps after Mueller handed in his report and noting that the administration “has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel’s report.”	article832916508.txt	1120
Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	article738361208.txt	0
Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.	article738361208.txt	55
Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.	article738361208.txt	229
He will do a fantastic job!	article738361208.txt	368
Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!	article738361208.txt	396
Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.	article738361208.txt	440
Congratulations to all!”	article738361208.txt	524
This is yet another big shake up for Trump’s still young administration   and it may be the most important one to date.	article738361208.txt	549
The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.	article738361208.txt	669
If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s.	article738361208.txt	823
Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs.	article738361208.txt	908
In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too.	article738361208.txt	1040
While he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting ” itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.”	article738361208.txt	1096
Again, if you liked Obama era, world on fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.	article738361208.txt	1343
Pompeo also isn’t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks.	article738361208.txt	1457
“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.	article738361208.txt	1636
In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence   the GRU   had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.	article738361208.txt	1778
And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,” he said.	article738361208.txt	2033
Pompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea.	article738361208.txt	2156
Clinton City…	article738361208.txt	2296
Moving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing’s looking any brighter.	article738361208.txt	2310
She’s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept:	article738361208.txt	2396
IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake up” by then Director John Brennan.	article738361208.txt	2511
As Miller documented, this official   whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time   was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush era torture regime.	article738361208.txt	2723
As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.	article738361208.txt	2915
Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand”   part of the CIA’s network of “black sites”   “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.	article738361208.txt	3056
Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.	article738361208.txt	3407
The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.	article738361208.txt	3598
A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.	article738361208.txt	3849
Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump.	article738361208.txt	3951
Blue Privilege: Amber Guyger Free on Bail as Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail	article789454337.txt	0
The case of Amber Guyger, the police officer who admitted to shooting 26 year old Botham Jean in his apartment for no reason, is a glaring example of “blue privilege” at work in our society.	article789454337.txt	97
Guyger claims that she accidentally entered the wrong apartment and shot a man who she thought was a burglar, however, eyewitness testimony has contradicted her initial statement.	article789454337.txt	288
Despite admitting to killing an innocent man and having her initial statement contradicted by witness testimony, Guyger has been treated as more of a victim than a killer.	article789454337.txt	468
In fact, Guyger’s apartment was never even searched for evidence, and she was allowed to “vacate” the premises without any type of search.	article789454337.txt	640
By not searching her apartment immediately, police ruined the investigation, making it harder to prosecute her.	article789454337.txt	779
It would be reasonable to assume that these steps were taken intentionally because they want to see her get away with it.	article789454337.txt	891

Meanwhile, Botham Jean, the actual victim, had his house searched immediately.	article789454337.txt	1565
Police claim to have found a very small amount of marijuana, which they attempted to use to smear his name and somehow justify the killing.	article789454337.txt	1644
It is obvious in this case that Guyger is receiving special treatment, not only did she get away without a search, but she turned herself in at her own convenience and was let out two hours later.	article789454337.txt	1784
Not even the richest people in the country with the best lawyers would receive this type of treatment if they just admitted to killing an innocent person.	article789454337.txt	1981
There has also been controversy over the fact that Guyger has been charged with manslaughter instead of murder, which will make it possible for her to receive a much short prison sentence.	article789454337.txt	2136
As Guyger walks free awaiting her trial, the 9 people who were arrested protesting the murder and Guyger’s special treatment are still sitting behind bars.	article789454337.txt	2325
After a ceremony for Botham Jean, the protesters were arrested for obstructing traffic.	article789454337.txt	2481

“The officer responsible for the completely unjustifiable shooting death of O’Shea Terry has been returned to light duty and has faced no criminal charges whatsoever.	article789454337.txt	3032
The officer who shot and killed Botham Jean remains on the Dallas police force and was able to bond out on manslaughter charges in a fraction of the time the protestors have spent in jail,” Merritt said in a statement.	article789454337.txt	3199
Merrit cast suspicion on the police for intentionally keeping these protestors in jail to send a message and make an example out of them.	article789454337.txt	3418
The reaction from the police, in this case, has shown that they believe they have a license to kill and that they cannot be trusted to monitor themselves and keep one another in check.	article789454337.txt	3556

“The Latest: Compound incident called anti Muslim propaganda,” Associated Press, August 10, 2018 (thanks to the Geller Report):	article778730964.txt	1155
TAOS, N.M. (AP)   The Latest on 11 children found living in a filthy, makeshift compound in New Mexico (all times local): 4 p.m. A representative of a New York mosque says the raid of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico is being used as propaganda against Muslims.	article778730964.txt	1283
Ali Abdul Karim Judan, a spokesman for the mosque, said in a video posted Thursday on Facebook that the incident was a domestic situation that has nothing to do with extremism.	article778730964.txt	1548
The grandfather of a severely disabled boy, who authorities say was kidnapped by his father and taken to the compound, has said remains found there are those of his grandson.	article778730964.txt	1725

CNN has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the revocation of press credentials from its reporter Jim Acosta demanding they be restored.	article999000874.txt	176
The suit alleges the ban violated both First and Fifth Amendment rights of the network and reporter.	article999000874.txt	331
Last Wednesday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made the announcement that Acosta’s press pass had been suspended as a result of an altercation during a press conference when Acosta refused to give up the microphone after several requests by President Trump to hand it over.	article999000874.txt	432
Not only did Acosta refuse to hand over the microphone, but he pushed the female interns hand away when she tried to follow the presidents request to take the microphone away from Acosta, who has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman.	article999000874.txt	716

Watching the full exchange it is obvious that Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before losing his patients with an argumentative Acosta who refused to hand the mic over to the female intern forcefully pushing her arm away.	article999000874.txt	1563
Acosta can deny how the altercation took place, but the video shows the facts, which are that Acosta was out of line.	article999000874.txt	1886

The network is also asking the court for an “immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim.”	article999000874.txt	2049
Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and there are six defendants: Donald Trump himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Chief of Staff John Kelly, his aide for communication Bill Shine, Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy, and the unidentified Secret Service officer who took the pass from Acosta.	article999000874.txt	2162

Complaint: https://t.co/43oX6L8xA7 pic.twitter.com/RvJ0Cgh6oi   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 13, 2018	article999000874.txt	3323
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	article999000874.txt	3433
Last week, Acosta’s press pass to access the White House was suspended “until further notice” after he engaged in the contentious back and forth over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico.	article999000874.txt	3503
Trump characterizes the caravan as “an invasion,” a term to which Acosta objected.	article999000874.txt	3708
“Honestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,” the president said.	article999000874.txt	3791
The reporter tried to ask him another question before a female White House aide walked over to him.	article999000874.txt	3882
Trump then told him, “That’s enough!”	article999000874.txt	3982
Acosta continued to try to talk as the intern was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand.	article999000874.txt	4020
She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn’t give it up and there was brief contact between the two.	article999000874.txt	4120
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his “placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.” She called the behavior “absolutely unacceptable.”	article999000874.txt	4223
Several news outlets accused Sanders of using a “doctored” video as evidence, but the press secretary didn’t back down from her decision.	article999000874.txt	4466
“We stand by our decision to revoke this individual’s hard pass.	article999000874.txt	4604
We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,” Sanders tweeted to accompany the allegedly doctored video.	article999000874.txt	4669
White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway has since said the video was simply “sped up.”	article999000874.txt	4811
An attorney for CNN and Acosta followed up with a separate statement, saying the law is “clear” that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment and Due process Clause.	article999000874.txt	4897

Monahan is Ellison’s former girlfriend, and she came forward a month ago to say the Democrat, now seeking an attorney general’s slot in Minnesota, sent her threatening text messages and physically hurt her in one of their confrontations.	article788273361.txt	920
Yet Democrats don’t think his accuser meets the same threshhold as Kavanaugh’s accuser?	article788273361.txt	1158
Apparently.	article788273361.txt	1246
More, from Fox News:	article788273361.txt	1258
The woman who accused Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of domestic abuse said on Monday that Democrats don’t believe her story and threatened to isolate her over the allegations.	article788273361.txt	1279
Karen Monahan, a former girlfriend, came forward last month alleging that Ellison sent her threatening text messages and once screamed obscenities at her as he dragged her off a bed by her feet.	article788273361.txt	1465
Ellison has denied the accusations, saying he “never behaved this way.” He did acknowledge he was in a relationship with the woman.	article788273361.txt	1660
The allegations didn’t lead to any immediate action against the congressman, except for the announcement that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would review the accusations.	article788273361.txt	1792
He went on to win the Democratic primary election for Minnesota attorney general.	article788273361.txt	1972
Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.	article788273361.txt	2054
Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during at a high school party nearly four decades ago, prompting prominent Democrats to get behind Ford’s allegations.	article788273361.txt	2184
“No, they don’t,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question whether the party believes women’s stories.	article788273361.txt	2398
“I’ve been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.	article788273361.txt	2502
I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.	article788273361.txt	2562
Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.	article788273361.txt	2629
My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.” She added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.	article788273361.txt	2681
As I said before, I knew I wouldn’t be believed.” Her comment came after another user pointed to comments made by Peter Daou, a Democratic strategist and former advisor to Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who wrote in a tweet that the Kavanaugh accuser will be “attacked, smeared, and demonized” and that people must “believe women.” Many other Democrats and progressives – who stayed silent when the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.	article788273361.txt	3004
Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.	article788273361.txt	3596
“I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.	article788273361.txt	3670
People can believe it or not.	article788273361.txt	3732
I don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.	article788273361.txt	3762
“The fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,” she added.	article788273361.txt	3849
“Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?	article788273361.txt	3946

Stacey Abrams to Sue Georgia Over ‘Gross Mismanagement’ of Elections	article999000858.txt	0
Stacey Abrams quits race for governor of Georgia, accusing rival Republican Brian Kemp of voter suppression.	article999000858.txt	70

Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams may have begrudgingly recognized her rival’s victory, but she is far from done fighting for what she believes was her due.	article999000858.txt	208
With a team of three dozen lawyers, Abrams has announced she would file a federal suit against Georgia for “gross mismanagement” of the vote.	article999000858.txt	377
Abrams and civil rights groups accused the winner, Republican Brian Kemp of purging thousands from voting rolls in that capacity.	article999000858.txt	519
Abrams remained about 18,000 votes short of a result that would have required a runoff between her and Kamp in December.	article999000858.txt	649
The Associated Press (AP) reported her team amassed nearly three dozen lawyers who will draft a petition, along with affidavits from voters and would be voters who argue that they were allegedly disenfranchised during the election.	article999000858.txt	770

In a speech on Nov. 19 right at the cutoff for Georgia counties to certify election results, Abrams delivered a speech in which she said, “I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election.” However, Abrams said Kemp had relied on “suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote” that was “deliberate and intentional.”	article999000858.txt	2075

Breitbart reports:	article999000858.txt	3016
Abrams could decide as early as Friday whether to go to court.	article999000858.txt	3035
Under Georgia election law, a losing candidate can challenge the result of an election based on “misconduct, fraud or irregularities … sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.”	article999000858.txt	3098
Allegra Lawrence Hardy, Abrams’ campaign chair, said that her legal team is “considering all options,” which also includes federal court remedies.	article999000858.txt	3286
Some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statues that set a high bar for the court to intervene.	article999000858.txt	3433
Abrams Republican challenger, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, has held the lead and is expected to be declared the winner on Friday, charged that Abrams has led a “publicity stunt” and her refusal to concede the election serves as a “ridiculous temper tantrum.”	article999000858.txt	3555
Abrams faces a narrow path to winning the Georgia gubernatorial election.	article999000858.txt	3824
Preliminary election results show Kemp winning with about 50.2 percent of the vote, which puts him with over 18,000 voters over the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a December 4 election runoff.	article999000858.txt	3898
Lawrence Hardy told the AP that Abrams believes that many of her supporters, many of them minority and low income voters who do not regularly vote, went to the polls and ran into electoral barriers, although she did not say what barriers they were.	article999000858.txt	4110
“These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,” said Lawrence Hardy.	article999000858.txt	4359

Accused Woman Abuser Keith Ellison Asks House Ethics to Investigate	article790499380.txt	0
Well, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep. Keith Ellison (D MN), who is running for attorney general in Minnesota without an active attorney's license, has not stood before a committee to deny or address accusations against him by several women who have accused him of verbal and physical abuse.	article790499380.txt	69
At least one woman even filed a police report about his abuse.	article790499380.txt	379
No, Ellison has called on the House of Representatives, not the FBI, as Senate Democrats have urged in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, to investigate the claims.	article790499380.txt	442
"I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved,” Ellison said in a statement.	article790499380.txt	601
“These allegations have lingered in the public sphere, and remain unsubstantiated," he added.	article790499380.txt	726

We do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh.	article790499380.txt	1474
Of course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation.	article790499380.txt	1550
The Star Tribune reports:	article790499380.txt	1628
The Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation.	article790499380.txt	1654
Ellingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works.	article790499380.txt	1771
DFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon.	article790499380.txt	1868
Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.	article790499380.txt	1993
After the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened.	article790499380.txt	2063
“All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.	article790499380.txt	2165
We are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,” a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further.	article790499380.txt	2246
The Democratic Party’s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday.	article790499380.txt	2409
The firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings.	article790499380.txt	2626
The contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.	article790499380.txt	2840
As we previously reported:	article790499380.txt	2930
Rep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan.	article790499380.txt	2957
Austin Monahan, Karen Monahan’s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night.	article790499380.txt	3117
According to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through “pure hell.” In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her.	article790499380.txt	3211
The alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned.	article790499380.txt	3430
State Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to “answer these allegations.” DFL endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations “extremely troubling.” Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her “kids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.” Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story.	article790499380.txt	3498
Ellison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse.	article790499380.txt	4057
And the relationship was clearly real.	article790499380.txt	4122
Karen Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years.	article790499380.txt	4161
The two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House.	article790499380.txt	4257
Records show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended.	article790499380.txt	4409
Ellison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced.	article790499380.txt	4489
It's hard to know what really happened in a relationship.	article790499380.txt	4560
And the media has kept it quiet.	article790499380.txt	4618
"Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend.	article790499380.txt	4651
The story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran.	article790499380.txt	4724
It blew up last night after the ex’s son posted the allegation on Facebook."	article790499380.txt	4819
Dave Weigel.	article790499380.txt	4896
It's not quite the first time for Keith X.	article790499380.txt	4909
This is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations.	article790499380.txt	4952
In 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s.	article790499380.txt	5021
Ellison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment.	article790499380.txt	5202
She subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation.	article790499380.txt	5311
Ellison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him.	article790499380.txt	5469
I'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections.	article790499380.txt	5574
Ellison won the primary days after the allegations were made public.	article790499380.txt	5660
Of course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh.	article790499380.txt	5729
However, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report.	article790499380.txt	5831
When it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy who simply does not want to answer to the American people and even seeks security to hide from a female report with a mic and a camera.	article790499380.txt	6005
Judge Kavanaugh has faced it all and fought back against it.	article790499380.txt	6208
Mueller Submits His Russia Report to Justice Department	article832908730.txt	0
Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his 22 month Russia investigation and submitted a report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, triggering a clamor from Congress to see the findings.	article832908730.txt	57
A Justice Department official told the Associated Press that Mueller is not recommending any further indictments.	article832908730.txt	254
In a letter to the heads of the Senate and House judiciary committees, Barr described Mueller’s submission as a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions he has reached.”	article832908730.txt	368
“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the letter said.	article832908730.txt	570
Barr did not detail what the report contains, but did say that the Justice Department did not overrule any decision Mueller made.	article832908730.txt	744
Barr said he will consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has mostly overseen the Special Counsel’s Office, about “what other information from the report” can be released to Congress and the public.	article832908730.txt	874
The White House and President Trump’s lawyers said the next decisions are up to Barr.	article832908730.txt	1102
There is a possibility that Barr releases two separate reports.	article832908730.txt	1188
One would summarize Mueller’s findings without including classified information and would be given to Congress and would then most likely find its way out into the public.	article832908730.txt	1252
The other would be given to a smaller group of lawmakers who head major congressional committees, such as the House and Senate intelligence committees.	article832908730.txt	1424
Rep. Adam Schiff (D CA), chairman of House Intelligence, called for transparency.	article832908730.txt	1576
“Mueller’s investigation began as a counterintelligence inquiry into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were compromised by a foreign power.	article832908730.txt	1658
By law, that evidence he uncovered must be shared with our Committee,” he said in a tweet.	article832908730.txt	1819
“And his report must also be made public.	article832908730.txt	1910
Now.”	article832908730.txt	1952
Trump has previously said he supports the idea of making the report public.	article832908730.txt	1958
“I don’t mind,” he has said.	article832908730.txt	2034
“I mean, frankly, I told the House, ‘If you want, let them see it.’”	article832908730.txt	2063
Trump has also vigorously denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly branded the probe as a “total witch hunt.”	article832908730.txt	2132
Mueller will remain as special counsel for a period of time as he and a small contingent of staff close the office, a Justice Department spokesperson reportedly said.	article832908730.txt	2242
The handover of the report marks the end of an investigation that has for nearly two years transfixed the nation, yielded dozens of indictments and convictions, and brought down a handful of Trump’s closest advisers.	article832908730.txt	2409
The Special Counsel’s Office was tasked broadly with investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matters that arose directly from the probe.	article832908730.txt	2626
However, the scope of the investigation seems to have bled outside those lines.	article832908730.txt	2861
Several witnesses, for example, have been questioned about other countries’ efforts to meddle in American politics, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE and Qatar.	article832908730.txt	2941
So far, the Special Counsel’s Office has indicted or obtained guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies.	article832908730.txt	3108
Six of those are former Trump associates, and 25 of them are Russians.	article832908730.txt	3219
No Americans have been charged with conspiring with Russians to meddle in the 2016 elections at least none the public knows about.	article832908730.txt	3290
But major Trumpworld figures were charged with a variety of other crimes, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, deputy campaign chairman Richard Gates and Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen.	article832908730.txt	3421
Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for crimes he committed while working for Trump, including the payments he made to two adult film star actresses for their alleged affairs with his boss.	article832908730.txt	3692
Manafort was sentenced in both Virginia and in Washington and will serve about seven years in prison.	article832908730.txt	3896
In Washington, Manafort was sentenced for for conspiring against the U.S. and a conspiracy to obstruct justice connected to his covert lobbying on behalf of Ukraine’s former pro Russian government.	article832908730.txt	3998
He was sentenced in Virginia for bank and wire fraud.	article832908730.txt	4196
The Special Counsel’s Office said in a court filing last week that it had gotten all it can out of Flynn, who has been cooperating for months after pleading guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.	article832908730.txt	4250
It’s unclear when he will be sentenced but his lawyers want to wait until the trial for his former business partners begins in Virginia.	article832908730.txt	4514
Gates has also been cooperating on a wide variety of topics associated with the Russia investigation, including the work of Manafort.	article832908730.txt	4651
As of March, Gates was still offering the Mueller team information about his time working for Trump.	article832908730.txt	4785
He pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.	article832908730.txt	4886
Several other law enforcement agencies have picked up pieces of Mueller’s Russia investigation.	article832908730.txt	4957
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is actively probing the Trump inaugural committee to determine if it received illegal foreign donations and if any of that money flowed through American intermediaries.	article832908730.txt	5053
The Eastern District of New York has reportedly taken over some aspects of that probe.	article832908730.txt	5287
SDNY is also looking into the hush money payments Trump made to two former adult film actresses via Cohen.	article832908730.txt	5374
A host of other local and state law enforcement offices are working on matters related to the Trump campaign and Trump organization.	article832908730.txt	5481
Congress has also launched several of its own probes into White House security clearances, Trump’s tax returns and possible obstruction of justice.	article832908730.txt	5614

What makes this recent purge from Facebook and Twitter so egregious is that the pages like the Free Thought Project, the Anti Media, Press for Truth, and dozens of others, did not fit the hate speech narrative these same companies used to wipe out Alex Jones.	article794344513.txt	1228
Instead, these pages were dedicated to spreading peace, bridging the divide, bringing humanity together and holding government accountable.	article794344513.txt	1488
And how does this poem end, again?	article794344513.txt	1628
https://t.co/nUZ82x9JFt   Anya Parampil (@anyaparampil) August 6, 2018	article794344513.txt	1663
The purge happened around 12:30 p.m. CST with mainstream news reports launching at the same time   implying that they were given the heads up about the move.	article794344513.txt	1734
In a statement co authored by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher   who Caitlin Johnstone aptly points out, also happens to be the former White House National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Policy   the massive social media platform explained that it has removed “559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”	article794344513.txt	1892
Facebook said the pages were “working to mislead others about who they are, and what they are doing.” However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.	article794344513.txt	2301
Our names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles.	article794344513.txt	2453
“We were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet.	article794344513.txt	2536
They have seen our “Articles of Organization” which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co founder lives,” Jason Bassler, co founder of the Free Thought Project explained.	article794344513.txt	2663
However, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge   elections are coming   and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore   like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh’s disdain for the Constitution.	article794344513.txt	2892
“Given the activity we’ve seen   and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections   we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,” Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked “people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.”	article794344513.txt	3223
It should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web   this is the very definition of grassroots.	article794344513.txt	3569
But all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play.	article794344513.txt	3754
Within all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers.	article794344513.txt	3882
Does Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page?	article794344513.txt	3976
We also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out.	article794344513.txt	4068
The only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves.	article794344513.txt	4219
All but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well.	article794344513.txt	4290
They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension.	article794344513.txt	4481
“This signifies a re consolidation of the media.	article794344513.txt	4532
Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.	article794344513.txt	4581
This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.	article794344513.txt	4765
Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.	article794344513.txt	4904
So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,” John Vibes poignantly noted.	article794344513.txt	5032
The bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information controlling establishment.	article794344513.txt	5245
We challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side.	article794344513.txt	5424
There are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the “they are private, they can do what they wish” argument moot.	article794344513.txt	5498
Facebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank   a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government   to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo.	article794344513.txt	5663
The entity that is making censorship decisions for Facebook, as publicly announced, is the Atlantic Council, a partly US government funded entity.	article794344513.txt	5973
At what point will the extremely tight ties between these companies and the US government end the "they are private" argument?	article794344513.txt	6120

Serving as a kick in the teeth to the thousands of people who lost their livelihoods yesterday because of this purge is the fact that pages who do set out to deliberately deceive people, put out actual fake news, and slander others   like the infamous Your News Wire   remain intact and able to post.	article794344513.txt	6299
No, we are not calling for these fake pages to be removed, but instead using it as a point of reference as to why they targeted us when pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies and deceiving people.	article794344513.txt	6600

A second man has been arrested in the slaying of two Ohio police officers for allegedly buying the gun using in the killing, federal authorities said.	article730246508.txt	101
Gerald Lawson III, 30, is accused of acting as a straw purchaser for the suspect, 30 year old Quentin Lamar Smith, who is a convicted felon and not permitted to buy a firearm, the Justice Department for the Southern District of Ohio said.	article730246508.txt	252
The Saturday shooting took place when Westerville police officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli responded to a 911 hang up Saturday and were "immediately met with gunfire" and exchanged fire with Smith, police said.	article730246508.txt	491

Bill Clinton: 'Public apology to Monica Lewinsky was enough'	article761575506.txt	0
'I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it.'	article761575506.txt	62
Former President Bill Clinton said his public apology for his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was enough.	article761575506.txt	114
NBC’s “Today” show correspondent Craig Melvin asked Clinton in an interview aired Monday if he had ever apologized to Lewinsky, who was 22 and Clinton’s subordinate when they began an affair more than two decades ago.	article761575506.txt	235
“I apologized to everybody in the world,” Clinton said of his public apology.	article761575506.txt	453
Melvin followed up by asking Clinton if he had ever apologized privately.	article761575506.txt	531
“I have never talked to her.	article761575506.txt	605
But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.	article761575506.txt	634
That’s very different.	article761575506.txt	701
The apology was public,” he said.	article761575506.txt	724
Clinton made his public apology in 1998 during the National Prayer Breakfast.	article761575506.txt	758

“I don’t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned,” he said there.	article761575506.txt	923
“It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine   first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people.”	article761575506.txt	1002
Clinton told Melvin that at the time the affair became public, “I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it.” He said later in the interview: “I dealt with it 20 years ago plus … I’ve tried to do a good job since then with my life and my work.”	article761575506.txt	1233
Clinton also said that he did not regret his decision to fight impeachment, and noted that he left the White House $16 million in debt from his defense.	article761575506.txt	1483
Clinton and author James Patterson appeared on “Today” to promote their jointly authored novel “The President is Missing.”	article761575506.txt	1636
In an apparent response to the “Today” interview, Lewinsky tweeted Monday that she is “grateful to the myriad people who have helped me evolve + gain perspective in the past 20 years.”	article761575506.txt	1759
She also tweeted a link to a personal essay she wrote in February for Vanity Fair on the 20th anniversary of the investigation into the affair, in which she admitted that she suffers from PTSD over the fallout from the investigation and publicity, and that the #MeToo movement had changed her perspective on the affair and its aftermath.	article761575506.txt	1944
CNN Reacts to Mueller News: ‘Huge Victory for the President,’ Trump ‘Vindicated’	article832916492.txt	0
A panel on CNN’s Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer reacted live on air to news that the Mueller report has concluded and resulted in no new indictments by admitting that President Trump has won a “huge victory.”	article832916492.txt	82
“He’s been vindicated by them,” Evan Perez said of President Trump and the Mueller report.	article832916492.txt	293

Later, a panel member concluded that the Mueller report was in fact a “huge victory” for President Trump.	article832916492.txt	737
“A couple of victories here,” CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz said.	article832916492.txt	843

White House Outlines Code Of Conduct For White House Press   If Those Don't Work, They'll Be Forced To Write More	article999001211.txt	0
For any constitutionalist, the ruling by Trump appointed Judge Timothy J. Kelly was nothing but surreal, and honestly, he should be impeached over his frivolous ruling that demanded the White House reinstate CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass.	article999001211.txt	115
However, the White House has decided to comply, which I wonder just how dangerous a precedent this sets, and as a result, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has issued a code of conduct for the White House press.	article999001211.txt	361
We have created these rules with a degree of regret,” Sanders said in a statement.	article999001211.txt	581
The fact that the White House submitted to such a ridiculous demand when it is simple human decency to conduct one's self in a proper manner, unlike how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders, President Donald Trump and a White House aide, is a testimony to how little those who represent us know of our Constitution.	article999001211.txt	664

“We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sanders said.	article999001211.txt	1555
“But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.”	article999001211.txt	1812
Oh, but there's more.	article999001211.txt	1934
If journalists can't conduct themselves according to these rules, then there is no other option but to.... write more explicit rules!	article999001211.txt	1956
Seriously!	article999001211.txt	2090
“At this time, however, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places,” Sanders said.	article999001211.txt	2101
“If unprofessional behavior occurs in those settings, or if a court should decide that explicit rules are required to regulate conduct there, we will be forced to reconsider this decision.”	article999001211.txt	2279
The White House should be telling Judge Kelly where he can take his ruling, but they are trying to look like they are on the high ground while submitting to unconstitutional rulings from a federal judge who should know better.	article999001211.txt	2469
However, here are the new rules released by the White House Press Office.	article999001211.txt	2696
(1) A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; (2) At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; (3) “Yielding the floor” includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; (4) Failure to abide by any of rules (1) (3) may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.	article999001211.txt	2770

Bill Clinton insists he doesn't owe Monica Lewinsky an apology	article761722669.txt	0
Former President Bill Clinton insisted in a weekend interview that he doesn't owe a personal apology to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose adult life has been defined by their inappropriate sexual affair and the global scrutiny that followed.	article761722669.txt	64
'No,' he told NBC in an interview airing Monday on the 'Today' show.	article761722669.txt	325
'I do not – I have never talked to her.	article761722669.txt	394
But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.'	article761722669.txt	434
'I apologized to everybody in the world,' Clinton said, implying that was enough.	article761722669.txt	502
And the flustered former president, more famous for his Don Juan like seductions than for his policy legacy, portrayed himself, not Lewinsky, as history's victim in the mass media's retelling of the 1990s saga.	article761722669.txt	584

'A lot of the facts have been omitted to make the story work,' he declared, 'I think partly because they're frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don't seem to care.'	article761722669.txt	1431
And Clinton complained in the interview that he left the presidency financially ruined because of the costs associated with the legal consequences of his actions.	article761722669.txt	1678
'Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,' he said.	article761722669.txt	1841
'I left the White House $16 million in debt,'	article761722669.txt	1901
He's worth about $80 million today, aided by an aggressive schedule of speaking events – many of which paid him six figure fees for individual appearances.	article761722669.txt	1947
In a March essay for Vanity Fair magazine, Lewinsky wrote that 'what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.'	article761722669.txt	2103

'I’m sorry to say I don’t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation,' Lewinsky wrote of the public humiliation that played out in seeming slow motion.	article761722669.txt	2801
'I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me.	article761722669.txt	3010

Clinton is launching a book tour to promote 'The President is Missing,' a fictional political thriller co written with the famed author James Patterson.	article761722669.txt	3095
He accused interviewed Craig Melvin of 'ignor[ing] gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don't know you don't know them.'	article761722669.txt	3248
'This was litigated 20 years ago.	article761722669.txt	3379

Lewinsky is pictured on September 21, 1998 meeting with then president Bill Clinton at a White House function	article761722669.txt	3463
If he were president today, he said later, his most famous extramarital affair wouldn't 'be an issue, because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts.'	article761722669.txt	3573
Patterson, too, defended Clinton – by comparing his sexual affairs in office with those of two preceding Democratic presidents.	article761722669.txt	3747
'It's 20 years ago, come on!'	article761722669.txt	3875
he blasted Melvin.	article761722669.txt	3905
'Let's talk about JFK.	article761722669.txt	3924
Let's talk about, you know, LBJ.	article761722669.txt	3947
Stop already!'	article761722669.txt	3980

'You think President Kennedy should have resigned?	article761722669.txt	4013
Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned?	article761722669.txt	4064
Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,' he jabbed.	article761722669.txt	4119
'I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus.'	article761722669.txt	4218
Suddenly philosophical and seeming to take a longer view of history, Clinton said: 'I have tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work.	article761722669.txt	4256

This vast sum is drawn from US taxpayers who have many unmet needs.	article773650987.txt	87
To justify such an enormous budget a major enemy is required.	article773650987.txt	155

The complex and its political and media agents will not permit Trump to normalize relations with Russia.	article773650987.txt	340
To prevent President Trump from reducing the dangerous tensions between nuclear powers that Washington has created, the military/security complex orchestrated Russiagate, a proven hoax, but believed by many due to its endless repetition.	article773650987.txt	445

Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev.	article773650987.txt	1861
To get rid of President Nixon, who made too many arms control agreements with the Soviets and opened to China, the military/security complex used its asset, the Washington Post, to orchestrate the “Watergate crisis” that the military/security complex used to force Nixon’s resignation.	article773650987.txt	2006

After President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to head the Central Intelligence Agency Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R Ariz.) said Americans need answers about her past involvement in state sponsored torture programs.	article738442776.txt	110
As I noted earlier today, Haspel’s long career at the CIA spanned the years of torture carried out under the George W. Bush White House.	article738442776.txt	329
A 2013 Washington Post report on the new CIA head called her role in the torture programs of that era “extensive” and noted that at one point she ran a CIA “black site” in Thailand where torture occurred.	article738442776.txt	466
In a lengthy statement following Haspel’s nomination, McCain expressed big concerns about what it means for the agency’s future, saying:	article738442776.txt	671
During his own confirmation proceedings for Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo repeatedly committed that he would comply with the law that applies the Army Field Manual’s interrogation requirements to all U.S. agencies, including the CIA.	article738442776.txt	808
The American people now deserve the same assurances from Gina Haspel, whose career with the agency has intersected with the program of so called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ on a number of occasions.	article738442776.txt	1045
The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history.	article738442776.txt	1252
Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process.	article738442776.txt	1369
I know the Senate will do its job in examining Ms. Haspel’s record as well as her beliefs about torture and her approach to current law.	article738442776.txt	1506
In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, our government squandered precious moral authority in a futile effort to produce intelligence by means of torture.	article738442776.txt	1643
We are still dealing with the consequences of that desperately misguided decision.	article738442776.txt	1806
Current U.S. law is clear in banning enhanced interrogation techniques.	article738442776.txt	1889
Any nominee for Director of the CIA must pledge without reservation to uphold this prohibition, which has helped us to regain our position of leadership in the struggle for universal human rights the struggle upon which this country was founded, and which remains its highest aspiration.	article738442776.txt	1961

Police charge suspect in death of two Westerville Police officers Quentin Lamar Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday By WCMH Staff and The Associated Press Published: February 11, 2018, 4:45 pm Updated: February 11, 2018, 6:02 pm WESTERVILLE, OH (WCMH/AP)   The Westerville Division of Police has identified the suspect in the shooting death of two police officers as 30 year old Quentin Lamar Smith.	article730093263.txt	372
Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital.	article730093263.txt	801
Smith was charged with two counts of aggravated murder on Sunday.	article730093263.txt	955
Morbitzer said the officers were responding to a “potential domestic situation.” A neighbor who heard the gunfire said it happened at a home where the occupants were “always arguing and fighting.” “The officers gave their lives in defense of others,” Morbitzer said during a news conference, struggling to keep his emotions in check.	article730093263.txt	1021
He called them “true American heroes.” The Columbus Police Department is investigating the shootings.	article730093263.txt	1355
Police released incident reports showing officers had been to Smith’s home or had dealings with him several times since 2017, some for alleged domestic violence involving a woman identified in the reports as his wife, Candace Smith.	article730093263.txt	1457
Authorities said he was wounded and was treated at a hospital.	article730093263.txt	1690
In a Nov. 29 incident, Candace Smith, 33, went to a police station and asked about protection orders because she said she and her husband weren’t getting along and she discovered she had a sexually transmitted disease.	article730093263.txt	1753
She also told police that when she “threatens to leave Quentin, he tells her that he would kill her, their daughter, and himself,” the report said.	article730093263.txt	1972
Candace Smith told police her husband “has a gun that he carries all of the time, and if it isn’t on him, it is close by.” Police were called to the home later that night to investigate a report of domestic violence.	article730093263.txt	2120

Federal Judge Overrides DOJ & Violates First Amendment: Blocks 3D Printed Gun Plans	article776126299.txt	0
In July, I reported that the Department of Justice finally settled with Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over his 3D print gun plans being lawful.	article776126299.txt	85
The DOJ surrendered in the matter and accepted the fact that the plans are protected under the First Amendment.	article776126299.txt	235
However, a federal judge, in a lawsuit brought by eight states and the District of Columbia, has blocked the plans from being released.	article776126299.txt	347
The judge should understand that these plans are protected under the First Amendment in the same way that any other printed material is, and that there is no crime that has been committed by making them available to people online.	article776126299.txt	483
Second, if that were not enough, we already know that the Second Amendment protects actual arms from restriction and the right to keep and bear them from infringement.	article776126299.txt	714

Fox News has the story:	article776126299.txt	1405
U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms.	article776126299.txt	1429
The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday.	article776126299.txt	1707
The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.	article776126299.txt	1811
In the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans.	article776126299.txt	1909
Trump said Tuesday that he's "looking into" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public "doesn't seem to make much sense!"	article776126299.txt	2048
Doesn't make much sense?	article776126299.txt	2191
Are you people serious?	article776126299.txt	2216
Why, yes, yes they are serious.	article776126299.txt	2240
Deadly serious.	article776126299.txt	2272
It makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public.	article776126299.txt	2288
The eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are.	article776126299.txt	2697

Washington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:	article776126299.txt	2901
...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns.	article776126299.txt	2979
In fact, the agreement states that it "does not reflect any agreed upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation."	article776126299.txt	3302
The lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.	article776126299.txt	3550
Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.	article776126299.txt	3672
That system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.	article776126299.txt	3780
Note that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:	article776126299.txt	3931
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.	article776126299.txt	3999
(emphasis mine)	article776126299.txt	4161
Since our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms.	article776126299.txt	4177
he is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one.	article776126299.txt	4502
Reason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:	article776126299.txt	4635
Josh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that "The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement.	article776126299.txt	4690
This latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule making process that began in the Obama Administration."	article776126299.txt	4838
As reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them.	article776126299.txt	4950
(Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.)	article776126299.txt	5203
While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do the distribution is already happening.	article776126299.txt	5309
Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter.	article776126299.txt	5556
He told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun making files, that "This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed because you all are trying to stop me.	article776126299.txt	5640
That seemed natural and ended up being true."	article776126299.txt	5997
So far, that has continued to be true.	article776126299.txt	6043
This federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs.	article776126299.txt	6082
Instead, he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in.	article776126299.txt	6226

Gina Haspel, New CIA Director	article738542398.txt	0
President Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel as the new director of the CIA, announcing the news on Twitter.	article738542398.txt	31
Mike Pompeo, the previous director, was nominated to run the State Department to replace the ousted Rex Tillerson.	article738542398.txt	140
* * * * *	article738542398.txt	255
IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake up” by then Director John Brennan.	article738542398.txt	265
As Miller documented, this official   whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time   was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush era torture regime.	article738542398.txt	477
As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.	article738542398.txt	669
Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand”   part of the CIA’s network of “black sites”   “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.	article738542398.txt	810
Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.	article738542398.txt	1161
The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.	article738542398.txt	1352
A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.	article738542398.txt	1603

Dallas Police Attempt to ‘Smear’ Botham Jean Over Tiny Bit of Weed and they Failed, Miserably	article787085939.txt	0
Dallas, TX   The Dallas Police on Thursday announced the findings of a search warrant they executed on the home of Botham Jean after he was gunned down in his apartment by one of their own.	article787085939.txt	95
The department is now accused of trying to “smear” Jean by claiming they found a tiny bit of marijuana in his house as if this justifies going into someone’s home and murdering them.	article787085939.txt	285
The timing couldn’t have been more insidiously planned as police released the affidavit on the day of Jean’s funeral despite having allegedly found the marijuana last week.	article787085939.txt	468
According to the affidavit, when they searched his home, police claimed to have found 10.4 grams of pot less than half an ounce.	article787085939.txt	641
Police also said they found two fired cartridge casings, a police backpack and vest, and a metal marijuana grinder the horror.	article787085939.txt	770

“They [police] immediately began looking to smear him,” attorney Lee Merritt said.	article787085939.txt	1610
“I think it’s unfortunate that law enforcement begin to immediately criminalize the victim in this case, someone who was clearly was the victim that has absolutely no bearing on the fact that he was shot in his home,” Merritt added to Fox 4.	article787085939.txt	1693
Pointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean.	article787085939.txt	1935
“I would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him.	article787085939.txt	2155
I haven’t seen any of those,” said Merritt.	article787085939.txt	2285
Merritt accused the department of conducting a “common assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.” Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations.	article787085939.txt	2329
It is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye.	article787085939.txt	2530
Even sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time.	article787085939.txt	2704
As the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police   who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake   Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him.	article787085939.txt	2788
“Guyger entered the building and walked down the fourth floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,” according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon.	article787085939.txt	3027
“She inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole.	article787085939.txt	3199
The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger’s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.”	article787085939.txt	3280
“Guyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by … Jean,” according to the warrant.	article787085939.txt	3393
“Guyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso.	article787085939.txt	3496
Guyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to … Jean.	article787085939.txt	3562
“Due to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911.	article787085939.txt	3677
Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,” according to the arrest warrant.	article787085939.txt	3791
At no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what “verbal commands” she gave.	article787085939.txt	3994
What’s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder not Jean.	article787085939.txt	4081
Attempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who’d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.	article787085939.txt	4186
What’s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start.	article787085939.txt	4388
“From the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I’m thinking that I’m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,” Attorney Daryl Washington said.	article787085939.txt	4611
“Well, the very first thing that I’m going to do is I’m not going to go outside and look at my address?	article787085939.txt	4778
I’m going to give them my address right there on the phone.	article787085939.txt	4882
I’m going to say I’m on the phone.	article787085939.txt	4942
My address is this.	article787085939.txt	4977
Why did she have to go outside to verify the address?	article787085939.txt	4997
It makes no sense whatsoever.”	article787085939.txt	5051
Even more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger’s story of inserting the key into Jean’s door and it opening up was simply not true.	article787085939.txt	5082
According to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean’s door, demanding he let her in.	article787085939.txt	5267
“Independent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,” Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News.	article787085939.txt	5351
“The contradictions begin to build from there.”	article787085939.txt	5565
The doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.	article787085939.txt	5613
This was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times showing that it closed every single time blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.	article787085939.txt	5693
Jean’s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean’s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.	article787085939.txt	5901
The hallway outside the apartment where Botham Jean was shot and killed by a Dallas Police officer.	article787085939.txt	6138
pic.twitter.com/2xN9xqppRC   Allison Harris (@AllisonFox4News) September 8, 2018	article787085939.txt	6238
Even as cops come to Guyger’s defense and attempt to shame, smear, and discredit her victim who was an upstanding member of society regardless of the plant they claim to have found they are failing miserably.	article787085939.txt	6319
Despite cops rallying behind the blue line to defend this killer cop, the rest of the country is not buying it.	article787085939.txt	6528
In a damning tweet, writer Kashana Cauley summed up the nature of the smear campaign quite succinctly.	article787085939.txt	6640
In response to cops claiming to find a tiny bit of weed, she pointed out that there was also a homicidal cop inside too.	article787085939.txt	6743
His apartment also contained an off duty homicidal cop.	article787085939.txt	6864

Grandfather & NY Imam Confirms Remains At New Mexico Compound Were Missing Boy	article778358096.txt	0

Fox News reports:	article778358096.txt	1262
The missing boy's grandfather, Siraj Wahhaj, a Muslim cleric who leads a well known New York City mosque, told reporters he had learned from other family members that the remains were his grandson's.	article778358096.txt	1280
The imam said he did not know the cause of death.	article778358096.txt	1480
"Whoever is responsible, then that person should be held accountable," Wahhaj said.	article778358096.txt	1530
A Georgia arrest warrant accused the boy's father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, the imam's son, of kidnapping the child.	article778358096.txt	1614
Authorities said the father at some point told his wife he wanted to perform an exorcism on the boy, who cannot walk, suffers seizures and requires constant attention because of a lack of oxygen and blood flow at birth.	article778358096.txt	1724
The imam said he was unaware of the training of the children for school shootings, but his mosque has been known to attract Islamic jihadis over the years.	article778358096.txt	1944
"It sounds to me it sounds crazy.	article778358096.txt	2100
But I don't know," he said.	article778358096.txt	2134
"I make no judgments yet because we don't know."	article778358096.txt	2162
Again Fox adds, "The imam's mosque has attracted a number of radicals over the years, including a man who later helped bomb the World Trade Center in 1993."	article778358096.txt	2211
Mosque spokesman Ali Abdul Karim Judan claims that the narrative is being changed because Muslims are involved and that this was nothing more than a "domestic situation."	article778358096.txt	2368
"None of the charges had anything to do with anybody teaching anybody shooting to commit acts of terrorism or to go in and shoot up any school," he said.	article778358096.txt	2539
"Because it's a Muslim and the circumstances that are surrounding their situation, they want to change the narrative."	article778358096.txt	2693
Eleven children were found in terrible conditions in that compound.	article778358096.txt	2812
That's hardly a "domestic situation."	article778358096.txt	2880
Furthermore, as I reported on Wednesday, both the Associated Press and the Atlanta Constitution Journal reported on the training.	article778358096.txt	2918
The documents claim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and his co defendants conducted weapons training at the camp where they were found Friday with 11 children in allegedly “third world” conditions.	article778358096.txt	3048
Wahhaj is also wanted in Clayton County in a child abduction case involving his missing son, Abdul Ghani Wahhaj.	article778358096.txt	3231
The documents, which suggest all the adults were involved in the training, say a person serving as a foster parent caring for one of the kids revealed the details about the training.	article778358096.txt	3344
BREAKING: Court documents say man arrested at New Mexico compound was training children to commit school shootings.	article778358096.txt	3527
  The Associated Press (@AP) August 8, 2018	article778358096.txt	3643
People can continue to put their heads in the sand all they want to because they know "nice" Muslim people, but the fact of the matter is that the history of Islam is anything but nice, polite, just or holy .	article778358096.txt	3687
It is a totalitarian, religious/political construct that is full of oppression.	article778358096.txt	3896
When you have those that actually believe the Koran and follow in the footsteps of the desert nomad Muhammad , then you will not find radicals, but devout Muslims.	article778358096.txt	3976
This appears to be exactly what Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and others arrested at the compound are.	article778358096.txt	4140
In either case, it is very sad that a little boy lost his life, possibly at the hands of his Islamic father and others.	article778358096.txt	4230

Paul told CNN’s “State of the Union” and CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he would do "whatever it takes," including a filibuster, to block the confirmations of Mike Pompeo to head the State Department and Gina Haspel to run the CIA.	article740235127.txt	229
“You really want a diplomat to be in charge of the State Department, not someone who is advocating for war,” he told “Face the Nation.”	article740235127.txt	473
“I frankly think that Pompeo’s positions are too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere,” he added.	article740235127.txt	609
"I don't think our policy ought to be for regime change, so I think Pompeo really isn't a good fit to be a diplomat."	article740235127.txt	727
He's right, too.	article740235127.txt	845
Pompeo has advocated for regime change in North Korea.	article740235127.txt	862
We've seen exactly what happens when the US gets involved in such types of regime changes, and the truth is that they really don't work out too well.	article740235127.txt	917
As for Haspel, Paul told "Face The Nation," "She oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture.	article740235127.txt	1067
I don't think torture is what America is about."	article740235127.txt	1190
On "State of the Union," Paul added, "I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster" to block their confirmation.	article740235127.txt	1239
"I don't have the power to stop her nomination," he said of Haspel.	article740235127.txt	1363
"There's enough votes she'll eventually win.	article740235127.txt	1431
Few things in life .	article740235127.txt	1476
.	article740235127.txt	1497
.	article740235127.txt	1499
[are] worth standing up saying 'enough is enough.'"	article740235127.txt	1501
"We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful that we think that torture is somehow acceptable," he added.	article740235127.txt	1553
"On what level could torture ever be acceptable?	article740235127.txt	1673
We should make a stand on this.	article740235127.txt	1722
She should never lead the CIA."	article740235127.txt	1754
Both nominations may face tough confirmation hearings, but it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices.	article740235127.txt	1786
The only thing I can think for that kind of reasoning is that people do not know their Constitution and understand exactly what Senator Paul is trying to warn America about.	article740235127.txt	1948
Instead, people are acting out of emotion and fear.	article740235127.txt	2122
Do I believe we should be concerned about North Korea?	article740235127.txt	2174
Sure, but I'm hardly worried that they will actually attack us.	article740235127.txt	2229
Am I concerned about jihadis?	article740235127.txt	2293
Yep, but I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information that has led to stopping terror attacks.	article740235127.txt	2323
And before you tell me about the media reports and CIA involvement, just keep in mind that a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA.	article740235127.txt	2468
So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results from the tactics used.	article740235127.txt	2645
Trump has obviously had praise for both Pompeo and Haspel, but then again, his administration has quite a bit of turn over too.	article740235127.txt	2733
Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.	article740235127.txt	2861
He will do a fantastic job!	article740235127.txt	2935
Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!	article740235127.txt	2963
Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.	article740235127.txt	3007
Congratulations to all!	article740235127.txt	3091
  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018	article740235127.txt	3115
We'll see how things turn out and I'm sure Senator Paul is not issuing an empty threat in the matter.	article740235127.txt	3167

Brian Kemp, her Republican challenger, issued a statement a day earlier calling for Abrams to concede.	article999001259.txt	1144
Kemp has declared victory and said it is “mathematically impossible” for her campaign to force a runoff.	article999001259.txt	1247
Abrams’ campaign did not immediately respond to a phone call from Fox News late Monday night.	article999001259.txt	1352
Abrams, 44, a Democrat, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 votes tallied over the weekend that favored her.	article999001259.txt	1446
Totenberg, who was appointed by President Obama, ruled in connection to Common Cause’s lawsuit filed on Nov. 5.	article999001259.txt	1620
Totenberg’s order doesn’t change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results.	article999001259.txt	1732
Common Cause, a nonpartisan group, claimed in the suit that Kemp, while secretary of state, failed to maintain “the security of voter information despite known vulnerabilities” leading up to the midterm.	article999001259.txt	1825
The suit blasted the state’s “provisional ballot scheme,” that could disenfranchise a registered voter at the ballot box.	article999001259.txt	2029
The suit pointed out cases where voters were turned around after computer glitches and cases where voters were not offered provisional ballots.	article999001259.txt	2151
One man voted for decades and was “disturbed” to learn his registration history was erased.	article999001259.txt	2295
The court ruled that the secretary of state’s office must establish a hotline and publicize it on its website for voters to see if their provisional ballots were counted.	article999001259.txt	2387
Totenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law.	article999001259.txt	2558
“I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it.	article999001259.txt	2713
I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,” Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history.	article999001259.txt	2825
A total of 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the state during the midterm, 12,151 were cast in 2014.	article999001259.txt	3058
Four Democratic leaning counties with the largest number of provisional ballots   Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett – “had not yet reported their numbers to the secretary as of November 11,” the suit said.	article999001259.txt	3165
The lawsuit also asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in another county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct.	article999001259.txt	3372
The lawsuit says that of the 1,556 provisional ballots Fulton County reported having rejected by Nov. 9, nearly 1,000 were disqualified because they were cast by voters whose registration records showed them registered in another county.	article999001259.txt	3528
Edgardo Cortes, who currently works as an election security adviser at New York University, said these uncounted provisional ballots could sway the election and, despite Kemp’s claims, his unofficial vote total is so close to 50 percent, a runoff is possible.	article999001259.txt	3766
Kemp was up 50.2 percent to Abrams’ 48.7 percent early Tuesday.	article999001259.txt	4026
More than 3.9 million votes were cast in the election, and Abrams would need to acquire more than 20,000 additional votes to force a runoff.	article999001259.txt	4090
Abrams’ campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push the deadline for counties to certify their results to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for “arbitrary reasons.”	article999001259.txt	4231
“This ruling is a victory for the voters of Georgia because we are all stronger when every eligible voter is allowed to participate in our elections,” Sara Henderson, executive director for Common Cause Georgia, which filed the lawsuit, told AJC.com.	article999001259.txt	4523
Who Is Behind the Internet Thought Police?	article763114850.txt	0
An article, “What the Red Pill Means for Radicals,” published on June 7 in the ironically named publication Fair Observer might have passed unnoticed as yet another uninformed, biased and ideologically motivated attack on all who ever get labeled “extremists.” The piece is so riddled with non sequiturs and wild generalizations that it seems almost cruel to rip it to shreds.	article763114850.txt	44
But the author is Bharath Ganesh.	article763114850.txt	421
A little online research reveals that Ganesh is currently working at the Oxford Internet Institute   at the esteemed Oxford University   on a research project funded by the European Union to devise ways to disrupt the “far right” online.	article763114850.txt	455
The project in question is under the banner of the Vox Pol Network of Excellence, which “is designed to comprehensively research, analyse, debate, and critique issues surrounding violent online political extremism (VOPE).”	article763114850.txt	693
This research group is only interested in violent extremism – according to their website.	article763114850.txt	916
“The qualifier ‘violent’ is therefore employed here to describe VOX Pol’s interest, which is in those that employ or advocate physical violence against other individuals and groups to forward their political objectives.	article763114850.txt	1006
The extremist nature of the politics in which VOX Pol is interested is thus not decided upon by project participants, but by the decision of those involved in particular types of politics to advocate or employ violence to advance their goals.”	article763114850.txt	1226

Note the claims – utterly disingenuous, as it turns out – that the labeling of certain people or groups as “violent extremists” is entirely due to their own behavior; in other words, don’t worry, folks, it’s all scientifically objective.	article763114850.txt	2076
This research is being used to advise companies who host online platforms, such as Facebook, as well as governments, on how to stamp out online radicalization – using strategies such as working out ways of preventing people from seeing material posted that is deemed unsuitable in some way, or offering them alternative “nice” things to look at.	article763114850.txt	2314
This is a seriously important issue.	article763114850.txt	2660
The people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information.	article763114850.txt	2697
They are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi.	article763114850.txt	2850
But who guards the guardians?	article763114850.txt	2909
For if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask.	article763114850.txt	2939
One could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so called “alt right” and the “manosphere”; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations.	article763114850.txt	3016
(Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)	article763114850.txt	3332
And the label of “violent extremist” turns out to be used very generously.	article763114850.txt	3409
Ganesh makes wild leaps and inferences.	article763114850.txt	3484
He talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque.	article763114850.txt	3524
This was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned.	article763114850.txt	3617
But why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh?	article763114850.txt	3676
The attack “was executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it.	article763114850.txt	3726
He found a narrative from British counter jihad groups closely aligned with the alt right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.” The British counter jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh “knows” they encouraged him.	article763114850.txt	3889
The BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs.	article763114850.txt	4212
Ganesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne’s mind.	article763114850.txt	4378
Rather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne’s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson.	article763114850.txt	4441
Yet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence.	article763114850.txt	4723
What “narrative from British counter jihad groups” can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque?	article763114850.txt	4782
I’m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it.	article763114850.txt	4927
But there is none offered – only surmise and Ganesh’s mindreading techniques.	article763114850.txt	5029
I suppose if you’re paid to fight online extremism, you’d better find it, or you’re out of a job and short of academic publication.	article763114850.txt	5107
We have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is “alt right.” He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist – he’s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn’t like the infiltration by the far right.	article763114850.txt	5239
He shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.	article763114850.txt	5519
The writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online.	article763114850.txt	5571
We have to ask.	article763114850.txt	5865
Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a “researcher” who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson’s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?	article763114850.txt	5881
There’s more.	article763114850.txt	6236
Bharath Ganesh’s profile tells us this: “During his Ph.D., Bharath was also a Senior Researcher at Tell MAMA, a national project dedicated to mapping and monitoring anti Muslim hate in the United Kingdom.	article763114850.txt	6250
He has given evidence in the Houses of Parliament on governance, extremism, gender, and hate crime and authored a number of reports in this area.”	article763114850.txt	6455
Is it simply a coincidence that this “researcher,” prior to coming to Oxford University, worked for Tell Mama, that factory for the production of bogus claims about Islamophobia?	article763114850.txt	6602
Who runs the Internet runs the world.	article763114850.txt	6781
Is this a partnership between Europe’s governments, the Internet giants, and Islamic influence?	article763114850.txt	6819

By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff’s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water.	article784143418.txt	2135
The dead body of a three year old boy was found buried at the site later They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group’s leader, 35 year old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses.	article784143418.txt	2407
In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille’s 13 year old son told investigators that his mother’s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to “get an army together” and train them for jihad.	article784143418.txt	2736
The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille’s teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand to hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico.	article784143418.txt	2982
The 13 year old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed “exorcism” rituals over the three year old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent’s affidavit.	article784143418.txt	3294
The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three year old ever being at the compound because they would “all go to jail.” Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim.	article784143418.txt	3598

Rand Paul says he’ll oppose Trump’s CIA, State Department nominees	article738781754.txt	0

Sen. Rand Paul (R Ky.) says he plans to do everything in his power to block President Donald Trump’s nominations to head the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency over war and torture concerns.	article738781754.txt	119
We told you about Trump’s administration shake ups and new nominees Tuesday:	article738781754.txt	324
Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.	article738781754.txt	401
Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.	article738781754.txt	575
He will do a fantastic job!	article738781754.txt	714
Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!	article738781754.txt	742
Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.	article738781754.txt	786
Congratulations to all!” This is yet another big shake up for Trump’s still young administration   and it may be the most important one to date.	article738781754.txt	870
The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.	article738781754.txt	1015
“I will oppose both Pompeo’s nomination and Haspel’s nomination,” Paul said Wednesday.	article738781754.txt	1169
The Kentucky lawmaker is the first Republican to say he will attempt to block the nominees; but he isn’t the first Republican to express concern.	article738781754.txt	1256
Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Tuesday that he wanted answers about Haspel’s background running CIA torture programs prior to her confirmation.	article738781754.txt	1402
Paul contends that the Trump nominations directly contradict promises the president made on the campaign trail.	article738781754.txt	1548
“I’m perplexed by the nomination of people who love the Iraq War so much that they would advocate for a war with Iran next.	article738781754.txt	1660
I think it goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on,” he said.	article738781754.txt	1784

2 Men, Moms Arrested After Child Found Dead, 11 More Found In ‘Filthy’ New Mexico Compound With Armed ‘Muslim Extremists’	article777785889.txt	0
TAOS COUNTY, NEW MEXICO   Two males from Georgia are in custody after TCSO served a search warrant at a makeshift residence that is best described as a “compound” in Amalia, NM.	article777785889.txt	123
Eleven children ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old were also taken in protective custody and later turned over to New Mexico Children Youth and Families Department (CYFD) for their own health and safety.	article777785889.txt	301
Three women believed to be the children’s mothers were also arrested.	article777785889.txt	508
Thursday afternoon Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe swore out an affidavit for a search warrant that states there is a makeshift compound surrounded by tires and an earthen berm in Costilla Meadows subdivision that he reasonably believed was occupied by adult Lucas Morton and others, including 39 year old Siraj Wahhaj, who was wanted for child abduction and 3 year old AG Wahhaj, the child that was abducted.	article777785889.txt	578
This warrant came after a two month investigation in conjunction with Clayton County, Georgia and FBI investigators.	article777785889.txt	978
According to Sheriff Hogrefe the FBI had recently provided information and surveillance on this location, but they (FBI) didn’t feel there was enough probable cause to get on the property.	article777785889.txt	1095
In the press release Sheriff Hogrefe said, “That all changed for me when a message was forwarded to us from a Georgia Detective that we reasonably believed came from someone at the compound – the message sent to a third party simply said in part “we are starving and need food and water”.	article777785889.txt	1284
I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible, so I began working on a search warrant right after I got that intercepted message – it had to be a search warrant and a tactical approach for our own safety because we had learned the occupants were most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief.	article777785889.txt	1573
We also knew from the layout of the compound they would have an advantage if we didn’t deploy tactfully and quickly.”	article777785889.txt	1967
On Friday morning, August 3, 2018, eight members of TCSO’s Sheriff’s Response Team (SRT) were assisted by four members of the State OSI unit when they executed the search warrant.	article777785889.txt	2085
The “all day” operation went without major incident or any injuries, but when encountered both men initially refused to follow verbal direction and Wahhaj who was held up inside the compound was heavily armed with an AR15 rifle, five loaded 30 round magazines, and four loaded pistols, including one in his pocket when he was taken down.	article777785889.txt	2265
Many more rounds of ammo were found in the makeshift compound that consists of a small travel trailer buried in the ground covered by plastic with no water, plumbing, or electricity.	article777785889.txt	2603
“The only food We saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer,” said Hogrefe.	article777785889.txt	2786
“But what was most surprising, and heartbreaking was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing.”	article777785889.txt	2884
The body of a yound boy was also located, however, it is not clear if the boy is the missing child from Georgia.	article777785889.txt	3158
Both males were arrested; Morton was charged with harboring a fugitive and Wahhaj was booked on his no bond Georgia warrant for child abduction.	article777785889.txt	3271
The three females believed to be the mothers of the eleven children, Jany Leveille age 35, Hujrah Wahhaj age 38, and Subhannah Wahhaj age 35 were arrested without incident in Taos and were later booked in the Taos Adult Detention Center.	article777785889.txt	3416
“We all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had – it was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen.”	article777785889.txt	3654
None of the adults would give statement to the current whereabouts of AG Wahhaj, but it is reasonably believed he was there a few weeks ago.	article777785889.txt	3774
The investigation is fluid and ongoing.	article777785889.txt	3915

The father of a missing 4 year old Georgia boy was training children at a filthy New Mexico compound to commit school shootings, prosecutors alleged in court documents Wednesday.	article778507244.txt	183
The documents say Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was conducting weapons training with assault rifles at the compound near the Colorado border that was raided by authorities Friday.	article778507244.txt	362
Prosecutor Timothy Hasson filed the court documents while asking that Wahhaj be held without bail after he was arrested last week with four other adults facing child abuse charges.	article778507244.txt	529
Authorities are also awaiting word on whether human remains found at the site were those of Wahhaj's son, who is severely disabled and went missing in December in Jonesboro, Georgia, near Atlanta.	article778507244.txt	710

Not Surprising: Now Fox News Is Supporting CNN & Jim Acosta	article999001299.txt	0

Other than that, they have liberals and neo cons running rampant.	article999001299.txt	193

However, the cable news channel is showing more and more that it is not fair and balanced and is far from what conservatives think it is as it blasted the White House about not giving little Jimmy his press pass back.	article999001299.txt	1569
In a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace, he wrote:	article999001299.txt	1787
“Fox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter’s press credential.	article999001299.txt	1847

So, file it!	article999001299.txt	2288
On the basis of what, Mr. Wallace?	article999001299.txt	2301
The free press still exists, and you know what?	article999001299.txt	2336
Jim Acosta and CNN continue to lie, just like they have for decades, and here's the proof.	article999001299.txt	2384
Look how they doctored the video to not show what clearly took place and then lied about it, and I suppose Fox falls right in line with that behavior.	article999001299.txt	2475
So, Fox joins with the least trusted name in news, the Clown News Network, to go after the White House on something that is the White House's prerogative and claim it's about free press.	article999001299.txt	2626
It's not.	article999001299.txt	2813
Fox reported:	article999001299.txt	2823
The White House Correspondents’ Association – of which Fox News is a member – issued a statement in support of CNN’s decision to take legal action.	article999001299.txt	2837
“We continue to urge the administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN’s correspondent,” WHCA President Olivier Knox said.	article999001299.txt	2985
“The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.” However, several prominent media members – such as Pulitzer Prize winning Watergate journalist Bob Woodward – have criticized CNN over the lawsuit.	article999001299.txt	3119
As they should.	article999001299.txt	3390
It's frivolous, but because they are immature children over at CNN, it's not surprising, and frankly, it's no surprise coming from Fox either.	article999001299.txt	3406
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the CNN lawsuit "grandstanding."	article999001299.txt	3549
I wonder what she will call the amicus brief from Fox.	article999001299.txt	3631
"This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,” Sanders said.	article999001299.txt	3686
“CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment.	article999001299.txt	3796
After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions   each of which the President answered   he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions.	article999001299.txt	3969
This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.”	article999001299.txt	4186

It is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia.	article781672902.txt	82
Trump recognized that the extreme Russiaphobia, which the hegemonic neoconservatives had whipped up since Vladimir Putin’s statement at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Russia was a sovereign country and intended to act like one, was a threat to life on earth.	article781672902.txt	237
The neoconservatives, who have controlled US foreign policy since the Clinton regime, are unwilling to accept limitations by any other country on Washington’s ability to act unilaterally.	article781672902.txt	509
When Putin blocked the Obama regime’s invasion of Syria and bombing of Iran, the neoconservatives paid Putin back by using NGOs and Ukranian politicians financed by Washington to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine and to put in office a government hostile to Russia.	article781672902.txt	697
The intent was to use Ukraine, a Russian province for more than three centuries, to create problems for Russia that would absorb Russia’s attention and return a free hand to Washington and Israel in the Middle East and also to evict Russia from its Black Sea naval base in Crimea.	article781672902.txt	988
When Crimeans voted to reunite with Russia, Washington misrepresented the democratic result of self determination as a “Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea.” Such an extraordinary misrepresentation destroyed any remaining confidence the Russian government might have had in Washington’s veracity.	article781672902.txt	1269

As I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments.	article781672902.txt	1756
Donald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia.	article781672902.txt	1944
The problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently.	article781672902.txt	2149
After 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force.	article781672902.txt	2220
President Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail.	article781672902.txt	2316
From the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the “Russian threat” that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys.	article781672902.txt	2411
Only 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion.	article781672902.txt	2697

Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump.	article781672902.txt	2905
Comey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election.	article781672902.txt	3000
Based on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump.	article781672902.txt	3246
After two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people.	article781672902.txt	3458
Indeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen.	article781672902.txt	3590
He pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort.	article781672902.txt	3765
Mueller’s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line.	article781672902.txt	3979
Manafort’s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller’s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate.	article781672902.txt	4065
Manafort’s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as “A dark day for Trump,” with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office.	article781672902.txt	4201
Manafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application.	article781672902.txt	4479
We do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller’s frameup and an incompetent jury.	article781672902.txt	4616
American juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain.	article781672902.txt	4721
Even the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury.	article781672902.txt	4838
Remember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI’s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI.	article781672902.txt	4981
It is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages.	article781672902.txt	5222
Instead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.	article781672902.txt	5503

So, why did Mueller focus on Manafort?	article781672902.txt	5873
Let Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:	article781672902.txt	5912
“All the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject.	article781672902.txt	5964
“The witness may not only be “singing,” he may also be “composing”   that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal.	article781672902.txt	6130
“Under federal law, the testimony of such a “flipped witness” need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction.	article781672902.txt	6307
“Even one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.”	article781672902.txt	6427
President Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury.	article781672902.txt	6553
Knowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump.	article781672902.txt	6786
This tactic is used every day by state, local, and federal prosecutors.	article781672902.txt	6971
Americans who believe the indictments and convictions are unaware that 97% of the time the convictions rest on self incrimination in order to avoid worse punishment.	article781672902.txt	7043
In Manafort’s case it didn’t, or hasn’t, worked.	article781672902.txt	7209
Yet.	article781672902.txt	7258
Manafort is due for a second trial, this time for allegely acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and for making false statements not under oath to the US government.	article781672902.txt	7263
Reportedly, Manafort is being held in solitary confinement, a form of torture designed to break a person’s spirit.	article781672902.txt	7455
Like Manafort’s first trial, his second trial has nothing whatsoever to do with Russiagate, but you will never learn that from the presstitute media or from the Democratic Party.	article781672902.txt	7570
Manafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.	article781672902.txt	7749
What about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump?	article781672902.txt	7841
Mueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute.	article781672902.txt	7896
Therefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation.	article781672902.txt	7992
Cohen avoided a jury and said he was guilty of five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in order to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions.	article781672902.txt	8067
With regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements.	article781672902.txt	8305
He said that on Trump’s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump.	article781672902.txt	8389
The intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear.	article781672902.txt	8493
Apparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money.	article781672902.txt	8566
Why a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi billionaire doesn’t make much sense.	article781672902.txt	8780
But these are not the kind of questions that the presstitutes are interested in.	article781672902.txt	8938
Nevertheless, Cohen’s plea is associated with a case brought by another prosecutor, not by Special Prosecutor Mueller.	article781672902.txt	9019
I am not sufficiently familiar with US legal procedures to be able to say how this gets brought back into Mueller’s investigation.	article781672902.txt	9138
The facts are this:	article781672902.txt	9269
The US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia.	article781672902.txt	9289
Period.	article781672902.txt	9382
At some point Putin and Lavrov and the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will have to acknowledge this fact, or Russia will be destroyed.	article781672902.txt	9390
Trump, by declaring normalization of relations as one of his two principal goals for his presidency, earned the emnity of the powerful military/security complex.	article781672902.txt	9536
By defeating Hillary for the presidency, Trump inflamed the US media’s hatred, committed as the presstitutes are to Identity Politics and hatred of the “white male oppressors” who elected Trump.	article781672902.txt	9698
Trump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who “grabs women by the pussy.”	article781672902.txt	9893
The hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media.	article781672902.txt	10083

Whoever advised Trump to appoint Rosenstein, a person committed to Trump’s destruction, as deputy attorney general, which is the ruling position in view of the weak and stupid AG Sessions who recused himself from the Russiagate investigation, intended Trump’s destruction.	article781672902.txt	10690
A disreputable person committed to Trump’s destruction is appointed by Trump to destroy Trump.	article781672902.txt	10963
How can a person so unclued survive?	article781672902.txt	11058
As I wrote during the presidential campaign, Trump has no idea of Washington and no idea who to appoint who would support him rather than work against him.	article781672902.txt	11095
Consequently, he has a government working against him.	article781672902.txt	11251

There is far more evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States than there is evidence that it is a Trump Putin conspiracy to steal the election from Hillary.	article781672902.txt	11693

The Russiagate “investigation” appears to be timed to influence the midterm elections with unsubstantiated accusations made just before the elections in an attempt to produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach President Trump on false charges.	article781672902.txt	16018
The presstitutes would cover up the frameup.	article781672902.txt	16268
In other words, the real election meddling is being done by the Russiagate “investigation.” See here and here.	article781672902.txt	16313
Such an impeachment would be a coup.	article781672902.txt	16424
The consequence would be deep and permanent divisions in American political life and more rabid Russiaphobia that would result in war.	article781672902.txt	16461

More Independent Media To Be Shut Down	article798244842.txt	0
The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.	article798244842.txt	40
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.	article798244842.txt	228
Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.	article798244842.txt	383
Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.	article798244842.txt	501

If you haven’t already heard, Facebook has completely shut down hundreds, if not thousands of Independent media pages over the last year.	article798244842.txt	817
Some of the biggest pages include The Free Thought Project and The Anti media, with millions of followers each, and years of sourced journalism.	article798244842.txt	955
These pages, among others, became targets a long time ago.	article798244842.txt	1100
Working directly in the field and behind the scenes, I can tell you that all of us have been aware of the censorship initiative for a long time because it started approximately three years ago now.	article798244842.txt	1159
The complete deletion of multiple pages kicked off by popular media figure Alex Jones, was followed by a massive campaign of “fake news” awareness.	article798244842.txt	1357
One thing we need to remember here is, this isn’t about democrats vs republicans, it’s about the elite preserving their control, and at the moment, they are using the DNC as the mouthpiece for that.	article798244842.txt	1505
Thus, anything that slandered Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, for example, was labelled as fake news, even if evidence and credible sources were used.	article798244842.txt	1704
This is because she is part of that elite.	article798244842.txt	1873
This is cyber false flagging at its finest, where authority figures at Facebook and within government agencies decide for the people what is real, and what is not, These tactics are complemented by a large mainstream media campaign that created awareness about fake news.	article798244842.txt	1916

This has some validity, but ultimately, the fact that Facebook pages with credibility were deleted makes it quite clear what’s going on here.	article798244842.txt	2481
These pages presented declassified documents, information about corporations and mainstream media, real whistleblower testimony and more.	article798244842.txt	2623
Yet still, they were deleted.	article798244842.txt	2761

Their key strategy is to label everything as fake news to build an excuse to delete Facebook pages that are dissenting voices.	article798244842.txt	4006
You see, independent media, like CE, became extremely popular, receiving many millions in website every single month, that traffic came from Facebook.	article798244842.txt	4133
Independent media outlets were greatly surpassing mainstream media in their power and voice.	article798244842.txt	4284
This is something people on the outside can’t really see as all of this happens, but I am on the inside, so I see exactly what’s taking place.	article798244842.txt	4377
Eyes were shifting away from the small group of people who have controlled media since media’s inception.	article798244842.txt	4520
Independent media brought to light a number of facts that threaten the agenda of the global elite, like intelligence agency/government connections to mainstream media for example, and their plans in the middle east to basically invade, take over, and establish a government that suits the Deep State’s best interests.	article798244842.txt	4626
There are several examples from all fields that surround human life, from healthcare to politics, and it all seems to be controlled by one massive conglomerate at the top.	article798244842.txt	4944

No doubt that the Deep State will want to take back the presidency, but ultimately, we need to see the bigger picture here.	article798244842.txt	8181
We need to see what politics actually is, and the past few years alone have provided us with the opportunity to see.	article798244842.txt	8305

Why are harmful ‘things’ surrounding us constantly when we have science showing it’s not safe, like cell phone towers etc.	article798244842.txt	8979

Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means … We have a well organized political action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one party state … It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government … This ruthless power seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group … is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts.	article798244842.txt	9313

Before 2020, they’re going to want to silence anything that creates awareness about the corruption, deceit and lies that have dominated the presidency and the entire military industrial complex for years.	article798244842.txt	9824
The fact of the matter is:	article798244842.txt	10029
“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.	article798244842.txt	10056
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.	article798244842.txt	10198
We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” – Edward Bernays (“the father of public relations”), Propaganda, 1928 (note that Bernays’ book, Propaganda, begins with the above quote).	article798244842.txt	10334
This is what’s unravelling, and the stronger the push the unravel it, the stronger the reaction and response from the deep state.	article798244842.txt	10592
The Takeaway	article798244842.txt	10722
Recognize what’s happening, the massive censorship of information, coupled with the ridicule or finger pointing, or even arrest of people who choose to voice an opinion in opposition to the rhetoric that’s constantly spewed by mainstream media, which in turn is usually believed by the masses.	article798244842.txt	10735
At the same time, independent media represents a shift in consciousness.	article798244842.txt	11029
A shift in our perceptions, thoughts, feelings and general self awareness about our own planet is changing, and thus, change has been sprouted in multiple different areas, including political corruption and the stranglehold it has over our world.	article798244842.txt	11102
We are more aware, but there is still some ways to go…	article798244842.txt	11349
A good chunk of work has been done.	article798244842.txt	11404
A massive transformation of consciousness has taken place and it seems that a global mass is growing closer to a critical mass.	article798244842.txt	11440
The censorship of independent media is irrelevant in a sense, because the shift will continue to happen, change will continue to happen, and information that the deep state does not want the public to become aware of will keep making its way into transparency.	article798244842.txt	11568
Independent media will continue to have the opportunity to share information because of a lack of credible information and plain truth within the mainstream.	article798244842.txt	11829
People are hungry for it, and will seek it out themselves.	article798244842.txt	11987

If you want to see doctoring, go to 0:58 of the video above, and don't be drinking anything when you do because it's hilarious.	article999001280.txt	2705
But it isn't just Snopes or Politifact and outlets like that.	article999001280.txt	2833
Take, for instance, websites like MediaBiasFactCheck.com, whom I had to have my attorneys send a letter for their libel and they didn't just correct it, they removed it entirely because they knew I was two days away from filing a lawsuit against them.	article999001280.txt	2895
MBFC actually called CNN "left biased," which is correct but followed up with:	article999001280.txt	3147
Overall, we rate CNN left biased based on story selection that often favors the left.	article999001280.txt	3226
We rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to misinformation and failed fact checks from guests and pundits.	article999001280.txt	3312
However, CNN’s straight news reporting would earn a High rating for factual reporting.	article999001280.txt	3423
(5/16/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/15/2018)	article999001280.txt	3510
Straight reporting?	article999001280.txt	3555
You must be kidding me?	article999001280.txt	3575
Did David Van Zandt not watch Jim Acosta lie to Anderson Cooper about this episode and Cooper just sat there and let him lie to the American people, editing the video to not even show the point of contact in question?	article999001280.txt	3599
Why yes, yes, he did!	article999001280.txt	3817
Not only that but it appears the MBFC doesn't know the documented history of CNN's complete fabrication of "news," telling stories that never happened.	article999001280.txt	3839
MBFC isn't qualified to comment on the subject.	article999001280.txt	3991
It isn't just MBFC though.	article999001280.txt	4039
Newcomer NewsGuard also covers for CNN.	article999001280.txt	4066
This is supposed to be an outlet, at least what I was told in email and phone communication, that is simply to determine transparency of websites.	article999001280.txt	4106
Instead, they not only do that, but they go on to do far more than that.	article999001280.txt	4253
In rating CNN, NewsGuard posts this nonsense.	article999001280.txt	4326
I'm sure NewsGuard, Yemile Bucay, Anna Sophie Harling and Amy Westfeldt need to update this in the light of the obvious lies and editing of the Acosta video and decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by the Clown News Network, but you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard whose writers aren't transparent about their own political bias, can you?	article999001280.txt	4372
Nope, you can't, and you can't expect it when some of those writers write for other publications that don't measure up to NewsGuard's standards either.	article999001280.txt	4755
The reason this little incident shouldn't be let go of so soon is that it is one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias, which we all have, lies and propaganda.	article999001280.txt	4907
It should be used over and over in article after article to remind people about the total dishonesty and complete disregard for reporting the facts by outlets such as CNN and to not blindly trust self proclaimed fact checkers who will not tell you the truth either.	article999001280.txt	5080
CNN has lost its mind to the point that they are suing over Acosta losing his press pass.	article999001280.txt	5346
He was their inside boy, after all.	article999001280.txt	5436
But the real irony here is that the media labeled Paul Joseph Watson and Infowars as "conspiracy theorists" and yet, PJW has exposed their blatant conspiracy to smear President Trump, Sarah Sanders and the White House aide.	article999001280.txt	5472
And Jim Acosta believes he and CNN deal with facts and Infowars doesn't.	article999001280.txt	5696
Yeah, right!	article999001280.txt	5769
I'm sorry Jim, I can't hear you over the booming voice of your hypocrisy!	article999001280.txt	5782

Keith Ellison CONFRONTED About Domestic Violence Allegations Produced by Sean CampbellAs he arrived for a campaign event in Minnesota on Saturday, Rep. Keith Ellison (D MN) was confronted by investigative journalist Laura Loomer about the numerous domestic violence allegations that have been brought against him by two different women.Loomer questioned Ellison about a 2005 police report filed by Amy Alexander, a Democrat activist who he had a relationship with.	article784382409.txt	1198
With the police report in hand, Loomer asked Ellison to explain why the police report says there was a domestic violence call to Alexander's house, despite the fact that Ellison has denied the allegations.Please Support my Independent Journalism: http://bit.ly/loomeredTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION!	article784382409.txt	1663
Posted by Laura Loomer on Monday, September 3, 2018	article784382409.txt	1976
His supporters continuously tried to block Loomer, even trying to put their hands on her, cover up her camera and getting in her way of asking honest answers that Ellison owes the people whom he is asking to vote for him.	article784382409.txt	2028
Loomer asked why the police were called to Amy Alexander's house in 2005 over domestic violence.	article784382409.txt	2250
Ellison was in a relationship with Alexander at that time, but has denied the allegations.	article784382409.txt	2347
He fails, however, to relay his side of the story.	article784382409.txt	2438

It appears that with Ms. Monahan's claims and Keith Ellison's unwillingness to address the public with his side of the story that perhaps, he has not changed his ways at all.	article784382409.txt	5093

‘Emotional And Physical Abuse’: Muslim Brotherhood DNC Deputy Chair Ellison Accuser Posts Doctor’s Report Naming Him As Alleged Abuser	article788626289.txt	0
There is abundant evidence that Karen Monahan is telling the truth when she says that Muslim Brotherhood Congressman Hakim Muhammad, aka Keith Ellison, abused her.	article788626289.txt	136
By contrast, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Brett Kavanaugh abused Christine Blasey Ford.	article788626289.txt	300

Karen Monahan’s account in the doctor’s report is consistent with what she has been saying publicly since August: that Ellison was emotionally and physically abusive to her while the two were dating.	article788626289.txt	1713
Ellison is the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is the Democratic nominee for Minnesota attorney general.	article788626289.txt	1913
He has adamantly denied emotionally or physically abusing Monahan.	article788626289.txt	2046
“She states that she was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated,” reads the November 2017 report, a picture of which Monahan posted on Twitter.	article788626289.txt	2113
“She did not have any physical injuries that required an examination in the past.	article788626289.txt	2334
She identifies the individual she was involved with as congressman Ellison, and she is worried about retribution if she identifies him publicly,” the report states.	article788626289.txt	2416
Ellison’s congressional office did not immediately return a request for comment.	article788626289.txt	2581
The Democratic Party has maintained its support for Ellison’s attorney general campaign despite the allegations.	article788626289.txt	2662
DNC Chair Tom Perez previously said the committee was “reviewing” the allegations.	article788626289.txt	2775
Perez later deferred to an investigation by the party’s Minnesota arm, the Democratic Farmer Labor Party (DFL), which endorsed Ellison’s campaign in spite of Monahan’s allegations.	article788626289.txt	2858
Monahan wrote Wednesday that Ellison declined any meeting with her as part of the investigation.	article788626289.txt	3039
“I told the investigator I would be happy to talk with @keithellison [with] them in the room.	article788626289.txt	3136

Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta’s press credential	article999001323.txt	0
CNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.	article999001323.txt	85
U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network’s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta’s White House press credential.	article999001323.txt	190
Kelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.	article999001323.txt	392
He did not rule on CNN’s claim that the revocation of the journalist’s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.	article999001323.txt	445
But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.	article999001323.txt	568
The ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access.	article999001323.txt	664
CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House’s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.	article999001323.txt	814
“We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,” a CNN representative said in a statement.	article999001323.txt	944
“Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.”	article999001323.txt	1083
The White House said it would abide by Kelly’s ruling.	article999001323.txt	1195
“Today, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House.	article999001323.txt	1250
In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.	article999001323.txt	1333
“We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.	article999001323.txt	1488
There must be decorum in the White House.”	article999001323.txt	1598
Acosta’s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference.	article999001323.txt	1641
At one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him.	article999001323.txt	1793
It was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN’s critical coverage of him as “fake news” since the 2016 presidential campaign.	article999001323.txt	1908
CNN’s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta’s credential violates the First Amendment’s protection of free speech.	article999001323.txt	2106
It also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment’s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.	article999001323.txt	2232
“This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting   an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president’s point of view,” the suit says.	article999001323.txt	2475
Responding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.	article999001323.txt	2800
“If the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing.	article999001323.txt	2974
“There’s no First Amendment right.”	article999001323.txt	3160
The White House argued that Acosta’s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential.	article999001323.txt	3196
Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge’s decision, which he said was not a surprise.	article999001323.txt	3330
“The White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that’s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it’s important that the court stood up and said that,” Lukasiewicz said.	article999001323.txt	3524
“It’s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn’t like.”	article999001323.txt	3775
Lukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.	article999001323.txt	3864
“The law and the Constitution is very clear here,” he said.	article999001323.txt	3983
CNN’s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump’s criticisms of the network’s coverage.	article999001323.txt	4043
Rival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.	article999001323.txt	4218
Fox News commentators were President Barack Obama’s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private.	article999001323.txt	4419
But the press credentials for its conservative leaning network were never revoked.	article999001323.txt	4578
Fox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN.	article999001323.txt	4661

London: Massive Crowds Gather to Hear Geert Wilders Demand Tommy Robinson's Release https://t.co/VIddLmcZx9 via @BreitbartNews   Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 9, 2018	article763412406.txt	1471
In his speech, he encouraged those listening that they were not alone, and said the gathering of the people was meant to be a voice to the UK government to "Free Tommy Robinson!"	article763412406.txt	1646
Batten echoed that sentiment saying, “Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner."	article763412406.txt	1825
“Whatever the legal technicalities of his alleged contempt of court, he was imprisoned more for who he is and what he says rather than what he is supposed to have done.," he added.	article763412406.txt	1904
“It’s not necessary to agree with everything he says, it’s not necessary to approve of everything he does, but history will judge him as being on the right side of a struggle between good and evil,” Batten continued.	article763412406.txt	2085
He then went on to blast the policies of the UK that are truly harming their own people, specifically “widespread, organized, paedophile rape of little girls by organized gangs” while those in authority “brush it under the carpet.”	article763412406.txt	2302
“Governments in this country and across Europe are now the enemies of their own people, [and] they promote policies that are against the interests of their own people,” he railed   citing efforts to sabotage Brexit, uncontrolled mass migration, and what he described as “Islamisation” in particular," he said.	article763412406.txt	2534
“A literalist interpretation of the Mohammedan cult is completely alien to everything our country stands for and our traditional way of life," Batten continued.	article763412406.txt	2844
“And yet instead of opposing Islamisation, our government is submitting and surrendering to it.	article763412406.txt	3005
They have betrayed the British people."	article763412406.txt	3101
“Now, ‘Islam’ means ‘Submission’.	article763412406.txt	3141
You either submit, or you resist.	article763412406.txt	3175
Are you going to submit?” he asked the crowds.	article763412406.txt	3209
“Are you going to resist?”	article763412406.txt	3256
The crowd shouted back their support of resisting and not submitting to the Islamization of their culture.	article763412406.txt	3283
Sharia Watch founder Anne Marie Waters also spoke at the rally.	article763412406.txt	3390
“Our leaders, our media, our police, all prioritize Islam in their decision making,” she said.	article763412406.txt	3454
“Why is it so easy for our state to jail Tommy Robinson, when it is so difficult to jail a group of men found with an underage girl in a bedroom?	article763412406.txt	3549
Why is it so much easier to jail Tommy Robinson?	article763412406.txt	3695
“Why is it so easy to jail a man for leaving bacon at a mosque, but so difficult to jail jihadis who preach murder and death to the British people?"	article763412406.txt	3744
she continued in a line of questioning.	article763412406.txt	3893
“Why is it so easy for judges to make rulings that allow known terrorists and jihadists to stay in our country?	article763412406.txt	3933
Why is the British government allowing ISIS fighters to return from Syria and threaten our safety?	article763412406.txt	4045
“Why do we talk and investigate and get angry about an accidental fire in Grenfell, but are expected to immediately forget   or ‘not look back in anger’   about the deliberate, ideology driven murder of British children?"	article763412406.txt	4144
Waters went on.	article763412406.txt	4366
“And why are Muslims allowed to cover their faces with a black sack while the rest of us are subject to strict security?	article763412406.txt	4382
Why are children being mutilated and forcefully raped while the law looks the other way?	article763412406.txt	4503
Forcefully married, child married, while the law looks the other way?	article763412406.txt	4592
Why?	article763412406.txt	4662
Why are animals slaughtered in agony and terror and Halal imposed on all of us in a country that has legislated against unstunned slaughter?	article763412406.txt	4667
Why?"	article763412406.txt	4808
“Why is it so easy, Theresa May, to jail Tommy Robinson, but so difficult to do anything at all about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day?	article763412406.txt	4814
Why?” Waters asked.	article763412406.txt	5001
Well, the questions are obviously rhetorical.	article763412406.txt	5021
We know why.	article763412406.txt	5067
The UK is frightened of the Islamists, and by being frightened into submission, they are being complicit in the crimes of the devout Muslims there.	article763412406.txt	5080
My speech at the #FreeTommy protest yesterday.	article763412406.txt	5228

Kassam also spoke at the event, reminding supporters of what was happening all across Europe due the mass influx of Muslim migrants.	article763412406.txt	5431
Then he encouraged them with a piece of American history.	article763412406.txt	5564
“I’m sure we have some American friends in the crowd, on stage, and watching at home,” Kassam concluded.	article763412406.txt	5622
“You know there was a man called Paul Revere.	article763412406.txt	5727
He rode through the night on his horse.	article763412406.txt	5773
He said, ‘The British are coming, the British are coming!’ Well, let you tell you something; we’re here today to say a similar thing: The British are coming back!”	article763412406.txt	5813
I do hope that is true, but unless the Brits are going to put the same kind of fear in their representatives that the Muslims are doing, they can't expect to do what they want to do.	article763412406.txt	5977
What Britain needs is a return to the God of their forefathers, the One Oliver Cromwell served.	article763412406.txt	6160
They need to fear Him more than they do the Islamic terrorists and rape gangs.	article763412406.txt	6256
Then, and only then, will they render justice for the Muslim criminals, rid their land of such public idolatry and protect the people like Tommy Robinson who rightly tell the truth.	article763412406.txt	6335

Why the Coordinated Alternative Media Purge Should TERRIFY Everyone: Soon Those Who Hate Freedom Will Have Unquestioned Access to the Minds of 2 Billion People	article794141509.txt	0
Yesterday, the alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort to silence people who dissent from establishment views.	article794141509.txt	161
It’s just one more step toward a monopoly on information by those who hate freedom.	article794141509.txt	300
At this rate, they’ll soon have unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people.	article794141509.txt	384
And this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo and to seek a wide range of information.	article794141509.txt	480
Hundreds of alternative media site administrators logged onto Facebook to discover that their accounts had been removed.	article794141509.txt	602
Soon after, many of these sites and their writers found that their Twitter accounts had also been suspended.	article794141509.txt	723
Popular pages like The AntiMedia (2.1 million fans), The Free Thought Project (3.1 million fans), Press for Truth (350K fans), Police the Police (1.9 million fans), Cop Block (1.7 million fans), and Punk Rock Libertarians (125K fans) are just a few of the ones which were unpublished.	article794141509.txt	832

The reason given doesn’t really add up.	article794141509.txt	1717
Facebook told the LA Times that these pages had violated the company’s spam policies.	article794141509.txt	1757
“Today, we’re removing 559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior,” the company said in a blog post.	article794141509.txt	1843
“People will only share on Facebook if they feel safe and trust the connections they make here.” (source)	article794141509.txt	2018
But this isn’t actually what their spam policy says.	article794141509.txt	2124
Here’s the policy.	article794141509.txt	2177
We work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people’s ability to share and connect.	article794141509.txt	2196
We do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect likes, followers, or shares.	article794141509.txt	2373
Do Not: Artificially increase distribution for financial gain	article794141509.txt	2480
Create or use fake accounts or compromise other people’s accounts to	article794141509.txt	2542
Impersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or private individual	article794141509.txt	2611
Attempt to create connections, create content, or message people	article794141509.txt	2703
Restrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend before viewing	article794141509.txt	2768
Encourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses	article794141509.txt	2859
Maliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by:	article794141509.txt	2916
Attempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable information	article794141509.txt	2993
Using another person’s login credentials or personally identifiable information	article794141509.txt	3080
Promise non existent Facebook features (source)	article794141509.txt	3160
The Washington Post originally said that these pages were purged for “pushing political messages for profit” as you can see by their URL:	article794141509.txt	3208
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/11/facebook purged over accounts pages pushing political messages profit/?noredirect on&utm_term .fa1a364488b3	article794141509.txt	3346
But of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!)	article794141509.txt	3507
as do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to “Facebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.”	article794141509.txt	3588
The fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.	article794141509.txt	3753
Of course, the best coverage of this is from…Russia.	article794141509.txt	3933
Sputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.	article794141509.txt	3986
You may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.	article794141509.txt	4097
My friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project.	article794141509.txt	4349
He said:	article794141509.txt	4436
This signifies a re consolidation of the media.	article794141509.txt	4445
Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.	article794141509.txt	4493
This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.	article794141509.txt	4677
Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.	article794141509.txt	4816
So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news.	article794141509.txt	4944
People think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don’t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.	article794141509.txt	5127
For example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim’s side of the story.	article794141509.txt	5267
We give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.	article794141509.txt	5455
This also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.	article794141509.txt	5546
(source)	article794141509.txt	5729
Nicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly.	article794141509.txt	5738
He’s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies.	article794141509.txt	5854
He told Sputnik:	article794141509.txt	5920
Our approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti war voices and stories.	article794141509.txt	5937
All of our content is professionally fact checked and edited.	article794141509.txt	6094
I got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics.	article794141509.txt	6156
I wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy.	article794141509.txt	6290
Over the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook.	article794141509.txt	6425
The timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections.	article794141509.txt	6489
This could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections.	article794141509.txt	6589
The Twitter suspension caught me by surprise.	article794141509.txt	6680
I can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections.	article794141509.txt	6726
(source)	article794141509.txt	6849
Remember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms.	article794141509.txt	6858
Remember when this happened to Alex Jones?	article794141509.txt	6916
Back in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame.	article794141509.txt	6959
All of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers.	article794141509.txt	7067
I wrote at the time, “Alex Jones is just the beginning of this purge.	article794141509.txt	7210
It’s going to get much worse.”	article794141509.txt	7280
Meanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and “shadow banning.”	article794141509.txt	7311
Infowars is a massive profit machine.	article794141509.txt	7423
But what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?	article794141509.txt	7461
It hits us right in the wallet.	article794141509.txt	7550
And if they’re hit hard enough, they’ll cease to be able to function.	article794141509.txt	7582
Jones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.	article794141509.txt	7652
And to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses.	article794141509.txt	7803
It’s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.	article794141509.txt	7899
I know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.	article794141509.txt	7963
A site as big as Jones’s would be many times that amount.	article794141509.txt	8031
When all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn’t be hard for a site – and the dissent and information they share – to cease to exist.	article794141509.txt	8089
(source)	article794141509.txt	8237
This is not just about Facebook or Twitter.	article794141509.txt	8246
It’s about the ability to find dissenting information, period.	article794141509.txt	8290
Google is in on it too.	article794141509.txt	8353
A leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.	article794141509.txt	8377
Another Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart.	article794141509.txt	8441
The news publication reports that an 85 page briefing entitled “The Good Censor,” advises tech companies to “police tone instead of content” and to not “take sides” when censoring users… Google might continue to shift with the times – changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).	article794141509.txt	8536
If it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.	article794141509.txt	8883
Shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users’ fury… The Google “internal research” even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non U.S. markets, noting that Google should police “tone instead of content” and “censor everyone equally,” as Breitbart put it.	article794141509.txt	8986
(source)	article794141509.txt	9321
There are 2 trillion Google searches per day.	article794141509.txt	9330
PER.	article794141509.txt	9376
DAY.	article794141509.txt	9381
That should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.	article794141509.txt	9386
Combine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.	article794141509.txt	9454
This is where free thought goes to die.	article794141509.txt	9560
Ron Paul reminds us that truth is treason.	article794141509.txt	9600
Ron Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:	article794141509.txt	9643
“You get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,” Paul told the Russia based news outlet.	article794141509.txt	9733
“Challenging the status quo is what they can’t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.” “Some of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we’re speaking out of line and they’d like to punish us, and I think that’s part of what’s happening with social media,” Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti government or anti war voices can eliminate their “dependency” on the current social media platforms.	article794141509.txt	9887
“I’m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,” Paul added.	article794141509.txt	10339
(source)	article794141509.txt	10556
Here’s a video from last month with Dr. Paul’s thoughts about the social media purge.	article794141509.txt	10565
In it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.	article794141509.txt	10651
The danger – and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment – is their direct ties to the government.	article794141509.txt	10765
This affects everyone.	article794141509.txt	10877
If you’re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don’t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you’re missing the bigger point.	article794141509.txt	10900
Consider the fact that the “population” of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.	article794141509.txt	11037
That’s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events.	article794141509.txt	11159
People will believe what they’re told because there is no alternative information presented.	article794141509.txt	11282
There are no questions asked.	article794141509.txt	11375
It’s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.	article794141509.txt	11405
Definition of brainwashing	article794141509.txt	11461
1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)	article794141509.txt	11488
(Here’s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)	article794141509.txt	11702
Social media is a massive source of information and influence today.	article794141509.txt	11817
If the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we’re doomed.	article794141509.txt	11886
2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.	article794141509.txt	12002
So regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree.	article794141509.txt	12122
It will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like “the government is your friend” and that “you don’t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.”	article794141509.txt	12232
People who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.	article794141509.txt	12418
That should scare the crap out of you.	article794141509.txt	12503
What can you do about the alternative media purge?	article794141509.txt	12542
It’s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.	article794141509.txt	12593
But even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.	article794141509.txt	12752
Here are a few things you can do:	article794141509.txt	12832
Subscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.	article794141509.txt	12866
Don’t count on seeing their work on social media.	article794141509.txt	12918
(You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)	article794141509.txt	12968
Support them financially if you can.	article794141509.txt	13025
Many sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons	article794141509.txt	13062
Bookmark them and visit regularly – if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat.	article794141509.txt	13113
Share their articles on your own social media accounts.	article794141509.txt	13233
If they can’t get their work out there, we can help.	article794141509.txt	13289
Join alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.	article794141509.txt	13342
The truth is getting harder and harder to find.	article794141509.txt	13399
You’re going to have to dig for it.	article794141509.txt	13447
We’re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.	article794141509.txt	13483
The alternative media purge is just the beginning.	article794141509.txt	13606
And we should all be very concerned.	article794141509.txt	13657

Is President Trump a Traitor?	article772836731.txt	0
The US Democratic Party is determined to take the world to thermo nuclear war rather than to admit that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election fair and square.	article772836731.txt	31
The Democratic Party was totally corrupted by the Clinton Regime, and now it is totally insane.	article772836731.txt	199
Leaders of the Democratic Party, such as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, my former co author in the New York Times, have responded in a non Democratic way to the first step President Trump has taken to reduce the extremely dangerous tensions with Russia that the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes created between the two superpowers.	article772836731.txt	295
Yes, Russia is a superpower.	article772836731.txt	638
Russian weapons are so superior to the junk produced by the waste filled US military/security complex that lives high off the hog on the insouciant American taxpayer that it is questionable if the US is even a second class military power.	article772836731.txt	667
If the insane neoconservatives, such as Max Boot, William Kristol, and the rest of the neocon scum get their way, the US, the UK, and Europe will be a radioactive ruin for thousands of years.	article772836731.txt	906
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (CA), Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, declared that out of fear of some undefined retribution from Putin, a dossier on Trump perhaps, the President of the United States sold out the American people to Russia because he wants to make peace: “It begs the question, what does Vladimir Putin, what do the Russians have on Donald Trump personally, politically and financially that he should behave in such a manner?” The “such a manner” Pelosi is speaking about is making peace instead of war.	article772836731.txt	1098
The Tyranny of Good In... Paul Craig Roberts, La... Best Price: $5.64 Buy New $5.00 (as of 10:35 EDT   Details)	article772836731.txt	1644
To be clear, the Democratic Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives has accused Donald Trump of high treason against the United States.	article772836731.txt	1756
There is no outcry against this blatantly false accusation, totally devoid of evidence.	article772836731.txt	1903
The presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self evident truth.	article772836731.txt	1991
Trump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.	article772836731.txt	2148
Here is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi’s false accusation: “Millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.” If you don’t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief.	article772836731.txt	2203
Here is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: “Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors.	article772836731.txt	2589
It was nothing short of treasonous.	article772836731.txt	3002
Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.	article772836731.txt	3038

And here is more from the CIA bought and paid for BBC.	article772836731.txt	3177
NOTICE THAT NOT ONE WESTERN MEDIA SOURCE IS CELEBRATING AND THANKING TRUMP AND PUTIN FOR EASING THE ARTIFICAILLY CREATED TENSIONS THAT WERE LEADING TO NUCLEAR WAR.	article772836731.txt	3232
HOW CAN THIS BE?	article772836731.txt	3396
HOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE?	article772836731.txt	3413
WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION?	article772836731.txt	3474
The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans, as well as the rest of the world, desperately need to notice the extremely hostile reaction to peace on the part of the US Democratic Party, many members of the Republican Party, including the despicable US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and the Western Presstitute Media, a collection of people on the CIA payroll according to the German newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte, and the CIA itself.	article772836731.txt	3499
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and the rest of the corrupt filth that rules over us are all in the pay of the military/security complex.	article772836731.txt	3975
Just go and investigate the donations to their re election campaigns.	article772836731.txt	4139
The 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA’s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect.	article772836731.txt	4209
Do you know how large 1,000 billion is?	article772836731.txt	4479
You would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure.	article772836731.txt	4519
It is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting.	article772836731.txt	4624
Therefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict.	article772836731.txt	4716
The military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy.	article772836731.txt	4812
In obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy.	article772836731.txt	4951
If Trump and Putin do not understand this, they will easily be made irrelevant.	article772836731.txt	5074
They both can be assassinated, and that is what the statements from Pelosi, Schumer, McCain, Lindsey Graham, et.	article772836731.txt	5154
al., repeated endlessly in the propaganda ministry that is the Western press, encourages.	article772836731.txt	5267
Trump can be assassinated or overthrown in a political coup for selling out America to Russia, as members of both political parties claim and as the media trumpets endlessly.	article772836731.txt	5357
Putin can be easily assassinated by the CIA operatives that the Russian government stupidly permits to operate throughout Russia in NGOs and Western/US owned media and among the Atlanticist Integrationists, Washington’s Firth Column inside Russia serving Washington’s purposes.	article772836731.txt	5532
These Russian traitors serve in Putin’s own government!	article772836731.txt	5810

Americans are so unaware that they have no idea of the risk that President Trump is taking by challenging the US military security complex.	article772836731.txt	5977
For example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff.	article772836731.txt	6117
I was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget’s ability to meet its obligations.	article772836731.txt	6203
Republican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure.	article772836731.txt	6450
The Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984).	article772836731.txt	6631
The Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit.	article772836731.txt	6821
The Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.	article772836731.txt	6962
This was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups’ handouts in order “to cut tax rates for the rich.”	article772836731.txt	7122
The supply side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa’s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.	article772836731.txt	7249
When the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48 year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder.	article772836731.txt	7640
He said: “son, never set your senator up against the military/security complex.	article772836731.txt	7838
He will not be re elected, and you will be out of a job.” I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation.	article772836731.txt	7918
He replied: “son, the military/security complex doesn’t care.”	article772836731.txt	8193
My emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond’s pat on my shoulder.	article772836731.txt	8256
It grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.	article772836731.txt	8327
In the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president’s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.	article772836731.txt	8442
Later as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.	article772836731.txt	8595
Today, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us.	article772836731.txt	8731
Trump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government.	article772836731.txt	9217
The rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as “anti American.”	article772836731.txt	9594
If Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column the Atlanticist Integrationists the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane.	article772836731.txt	9670
Their delusions are setting themselves up for destruction.	article772836731.txt	9905
There is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted.	article772836731.txt	9964
Any government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.	article772836731.txt	10044
The entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein.	article772836731.txt	10136
The purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons.	article772836731.txt	10261
One is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia.	article772836731.txt	10322
The other is to remove Trump’s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party.	article772836731.txt	10384
How America Was Lost: ... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $8.00 Buy New $8.51 (as of 02:00 EDT   Details)	article772836731.txt	10479
President Trump is almost powerless.	article772836731.txt	10588
Putin, the Chinese, the Iranians, and the North Koreans should recognize this before it is too late for them.	article772836731.txt	10625
President Trump cannot fire and arrest for high treason Mueller and Rosenstein.	article772836731.txt	10735
And Trump cannot indict Hillary for her numerous unquestionable crimes in plain view of everyone, or Comey or Brennan, who declares Trump “to be wholly in the pocket of Putin,” for trying to overthrow the elected president of the United States.	article772836731.txt	10815
Trump cannot have the Secret Service question the likes of Pelosi and Schumer and McCain and Lindsey Graham for false accusations that encourage assassination of the President of the United States.	article772836731.txt	11060
Trump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.	article772836731.txt	11258
If Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history.	article772836731.txt	11422
As I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia.	article772836731.txt	11524
Leading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA’s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will.	article772836731.txt	11619
Here is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth.	article772836731.txt	12086
Here is what the clued in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.	article772836731.txt	12244
If Putin doesn’t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history.	article772836731.txt	12384
Keep in mind that no media informs you better than my website.	article772836731.txt	12455
If my website goes down, you will be left in darkness.	article772836731.txt	12518
No valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes.	article772836731.txt	12573
If you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope.	article772836731.txt	12652
Not even I can rescue you.	article772836731.txt	12754
Nor God himself.	article772836731.txt	12781
Americans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty.	article772836731.txt	12798
I doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power.	article772836731.txt	13028
The police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them.	article772836731.txt	13178
The rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.	article772836731.txt	13257
In the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus.	article772836731.txt	13443
Today there are no countries less free than the United States of America.	article772836731.txt	13763
Why do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?	article772836731.txt	13837
Are they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?	article772836731.txt	13922
If Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.	article772836731.txt	13971
There is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.	article772836731.txt	14039
Apparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism.	article772836731.txt	14103

Stacey Abrams ended her run for Georgia governor on Friday, but the Democrat said she would not concede the contest to Republican Brian Kemp and planned to launch a voting rights group to file “major” litigation challenging election policies.	article999001256.txt	1255
As state officials prepare to certify the vote, Abrams acknowledged the law “allows no further viable remedy” to extend her quest to be the nation’s first black female governor.	article999001256.txt	1498
But she laced her speech with biting criticism of Kemp, who she accused of leveraging his role as the state’s top elections official to suppress voters.	article999001256.txt	1676
“I will not concede,” she added, “because the erosion of our democracy is not right.”	article999001256.txt	1829
You mean like having a sister waiting in the wings of any campaign lawsuits, Ms. Abrams?	article999001256.txt	1915
What about invalid provisional ballots getting mixed in with valid ones?	article999001256.txt	2004
Maybe a little electronic voter manipulation, Ms. Abrams?	article999001256.txt	2077
How about non citizens and illegal aliens voting, Ms. Abrams?	article999001256.txt	2135
Are these evidence of the erosion of the democratic process?	article999001256.txt	2197
Sure they are and they appear to all be coming from the party that Stacey Abrams represents, but she's not going to talk about that.	article999001256.txt	2258
But she wasn't going to concede.	article999001256.txt	2391
Nope, that arrogant wanna be first female governor of Georgia simply would not bow out gracefully.	article999001256.txt	2424
“To watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in this state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling,” Abrams said.	article999001256.txt	2523
“So, let’s be clear," she continued.	article999001256.txt	2736
"This is not a speech of concession.	article999001256.txt	2773
Because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper.	article999001256.txt	2810
As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.	article999001256.txt	2886
But my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy.”	article999001256.txt	2945
No, concession means "a thing that is granted, especially in response to demands; a thing conceded."	article999001256.txt	3018
Abrams was easily defeated in terms of votes.	article999001256.txt	3119
She was the one trying to "find" and count votes remember?	article999001256.txt	3165
She is the one claiming there was cancellation of hundreds of thousands of voter registrations.	article999001256.txt	3224
Where is her evidence?	article999001256.txt	3320
She has none.	article999001256.txt	3343
Stacey Abrams is a sore loser just like Hillary Clinton and this little temper tantrum she put on display will probably sink any chances she may have had in the future to run again.	article999001256.txt	3357

Dallas Police Officer Finally Arrested After Entering Wrong Apartment & Killing Man	article786004130.txt	0
Last week, it was reported that Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger entered an apartment she claims that she thought was hers and subsequently found the occupant of that apartment home and shot and killed him, claiming she thought he was an intruder.	article786004130.txt	85
Now, after several days of outcry from the community, Guyger has been arrested and Charged with manslaughter in the death of 26 year old Botham Jean.	article786004130.txt	335
In a statement released on Friday, Dallas police said their officer called them after shooting Jean and told responding officers that “she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.”	article786004130.txt	485
On September 6, 2018 at about 9:59 p.m., an off duty Dallas Police officer called police dispatch and said she was involved in a shooting at the apartments located at 1210 S. Lamar.	article786004130.txt	687

Preliminary information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift.	article786004130.txt	1418
The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.	article786004130.txt	1525
At some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim.	article786004130.txt	1644
Responding officers administered aid to the victim, a 26 year old male, at the scene.	article786004130.txt	1709
The victim was then transported to the hospital and pronounced deceased.	article786004130.txt	1795
Next of kin notification has not been made at this time.	article786004130.txt	1868
The officer was not injured and will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.	article786004130.txt	1925
The Dallas Police Department is conducting a joint investigation with the District Attorney’s Office.	article786004130.txt	2038
This investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so.	article786004130.txt	2140
I have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly.	article786004130.txt	2266
Does Guyger leave her door unlocked?	article786004130.txt	2324
Furthermore, The Dallas News reports:	article786004130.txt	2361
Jean, who lived on the fourth floor of the South Side Flats in the Cedars, was home alone when Guyger mistook his apartment for hers, the affidavit says.	article786004130.txt	2399
Guyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says.	article786004130.txt	2553
When she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says.	article786004130.txt	2737
The door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit.	article786004130.txt	2865
The affidavit says the apartments' "respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar."	article786004130.txt	2976
The apartment was dark and when she saw "a large silhouette," Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says.	article786004130.txt	3093
The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, "gave verbal commands that were ignored" and fired twice.	article786004130.txt	3217
Jean was struck once in the torso.	article786004130.txt	3315
Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid.	article786004130.txt	3350
She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says.	article786004130.txt	3426
She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit.	article786004130.txt	3546
Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar.	article786004130.txt	3693
Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?	article786004130.txt	3784
In any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody.	article786004130.txt	3859
This was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, "she is devastated."	article786004130.txt	3970
Knowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend.	article786004130.txt	4064
In fact, this is not her first shooting.	article786004130.txt	4130
As a four year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017.	article786004130.txt	4171
The Dallas News reported:	article786004130.txt	4274
In 2017, Guyger shot 47 year old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her.	article786004130.txt	4300
Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest.	article786004130.txt	4387
When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit.	article786004130.txt	4503
One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said.	article786004130.txt	4690
Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her.	article786004130.txt	4783
After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said.	article786004130.txt	4852
Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting.	article786004130.txt	4955
Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole.	article786004130.txt	5028
In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison.	article786004130.txt	5188
The Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation.	article786004130.txt	5323
USA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20 year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine.	article786004130.txt	5381
A charge of murder may be forthcoming once the case is taken to a grand jury, according to Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.	article786004130.txt	5536
Trump Kept Asking Friends If the Mueller Report Would Drop This Week	article832908978.txt	0
On Wednesday, Donald Trump was flying to a military tank plant in Lima, Ohio, to deliver a speech on the economy, but, as is frequently the case, the president had something more pressing on his mind.	article832908978.txt	70
While aboard Air Force One, the president killed some time by picking up the phone and ringing associates to ask them if they thought Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would be sent to the Department of Justice this week, according to a source with knowledge of these conversations.	article832908978.txt	271
The report, which would mark the culmination of Mueller and his team’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice, has for many months kicked off round after round of speculation among the media and political class about when, exactly, it will finally be delivered to the Justice Department.	article832908978.txt	560
This week, the President of the United States himself joined in on the anxious anticipation and the Mueller report guessing game.	article832908978.txt	928
According to three knowledgeable sources, Trump has quizzed various people administration officials, friends, his legal team throughout the week if they believed the buzz that the Mueller report could be delivered as soon as this week.	article832908978.txt	1058
The president, these sources said, speculated on when he thought it would finally happen, repeatedly citing news reports from this week on a possible imminent delivery.	article832908978.txt	1294
Reached for comment, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied that there was “nothing to add right now,” as of Friday afternoon.	article832908978.txt	1463
“I told the president this morning [to] go about your schedule, we’re prepared for anything,” Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, told The Daily Beast on Friday, adding that he spoke with the president in person on Thursday.	article832908978.txt	1610
Giuliani said that he and the president have been hearing the report delivery could happen “today,” but clarified that he and his client are going off of media, not any “insider information.”	article832908978.txt	1849
Trump’s reelection campaign also got in on this week’s speculation game, texting supporters early Friday afternoon, “President Trump has put up with the WITCH HUNT for 2 YEARS.	article832908978.txt	2041
Do you think it's time for it to end?	article832908978.txt	2218
Take our OFFICIAL poll NOW.”	article832908978.txt	2256
The president, who has repeatedly claimed that the Mueller investigation is “illegal” and a “WITCH HUNT” driven by angry liberals, made clear to reporters at the White House earlier this week that the coming report was, of course, weighing on him.	article832908978.txt	2285
“Let it come out, let people see it,” Trump said, characterizing the probe and report as “ridiculous,” as he left the White House on Wednesday.	article832908978.txt	2533
“Let’s see whether or not it’s legit.”	article832908978.txt	2677
But over the course of the last two years, he hasn’t always been so open to the report seeing the light of day, or even having the investigation conclude.	article832908978.txt	2716
As The New York Times reported early last year, Trump ordered the firing of the special counsel, but reversed course after the then White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would resign instead of executing Trump’s order.	article832908978.txt	2871
Still, even after the Mueller probe officially wraps, it is very much the beginning, not a dramatic end, to Trumpworld’s wide ranging legal woes.	article832908978.txt	3091
On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Democratic chairs of six different House committees investigating Trump and his allies are planning on asking the FBI, Department of Justice, and White House to preserve records provided to Mueller and his investigators.	article832908978.txt	3237
President Trump himself appears to realize that the end is nowhere near.	article832908978.txt	3503
As The Daily Beast reported last month, the president made clear to his outside legal team, which includes Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, that he wanted his attorneys sitting tight, even after the Mueller investigation is history.	article832908978.txt	3576
Trump broached the topic in multiple conversations beginning late last year, while discussing the other inquiries threatening his presidency and inner circle, chief among them the Southern District of New York.	article832908978.txt	3802
But if the Mueller report is actually, finally sent over to the Justice Department by close of business on Friday, the president will be many miles away from it.	article832908978.txt	4013
On Friday morning, Trump flew to Palm Beach, Florida, where he and first lady Melania Trump were scheduled to meet with Caribbean leaders at Mar a Lago, the president’s private club and getaway.	article832908978.txt	4175
Citing ‘Adverse Conduct’ Police Finally Fire Amber Guyger for Killing Botham Jean	article789753303.txt	0
Dallas, TX   After the Dallas police department refused to fire an officer who admitted to killing an innocent man, outrage erupted, and rightfully so.	article789753303.txt	83
Now, however, on Monday, the department announced that officer Amber Guyger has finally been fired.	article789753303.txt	235
On Monday, the Dallas police department announced that the officer who admitted to walking into the apartment of 26 year old Botham Jean and killing him was finally fired.	article789753303.txt	335
“Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall terminated Police Officer Amber Guyger, #10702, during a hearing held September 24, 2018,” the statement read.	article789753303.txt	507
“An Internal Affairs investigation concluded that on September 9, 2018, Officer Guyger, #10702, engaged in adverse conduct when she was arrested for Manslaughter.”	article789753303.txt	653

The department then went on to note that Guyger could appeal this firing under their civil service rules.	article789753303.txt	1366
Officer Guyger was terminated for her actions.	article789753303.txt	1472
She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division.	article789753303.txt	1519
Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline.	article789753303.txt	1601
This move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired.	article789753303.txt	1683
As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, “There is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger.	article789753303.txt	1811
I don’t want to interfere with the on going criminal investigation into her actions.”	article789753303.txt	2003
Also, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law.	article789753303.txt	2089
“I can’t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action.	article789753303.txt	2228
There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall.	article789753303.txt	2335
Apparently, it is no longer against the law.	article789753303.txt	2398
This news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.	article789753303.txt	2443
As TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong.	article789753303.txt	2592
While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him.	article789753303.txt	2721
This is a fact.	article789753303.txt	2829
This public servant walked into an innocent man’s home and shot him dead.	article789753303.txt	2845
Because of her actions, this man no longer lives.	article789753303.txt	2919
This alone should have been enough to fire her.	article789753303.txt	2969
Surprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, “Good,” showing her support for the move.	article789753303.txt	3017
For those who don’t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today.	article789753303.txt	3158
Indeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George’s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment.	article789753303.txt	3305
He shot two officers.	article789753303.txt	3446
Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.	article789753303.txt	3468
In response to Guyger’s termination, the family’s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed “satisfaction” with the move.	article789753303.txt	3547
“The Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger’s termination.	article789753303.txt	3681
We see it as an initial victory   well received on the day Botham Jean is laid to rest in his native country in St. Lucia,” Merritt’s office said in a statement, adding that they are committed to see a “proper murder indictment, conviction and appropriate sentencing.”	article789753303.txt	3770

Texas: Cop Walks Into Home She Thought Was Hers, Kills Innocent Homeowner Not Arrested	article785331076.txt	0
Dallas, TX   Highlighting the sheer insane state of law enforcement in America today is a tragic story out of Dallas this week.	article785331076.txt	88
An off duty police officer walked into the wrong home after getting off shift, thought the homeowner was an intruder, and killed him.	article785331076.txt	216
And, she has not yet been arrested.	article785331076.txt	350
The victim was 26 year old Bothan Shem Jean who was most likely startled by someone coming into his home at 10:00 pm when the unnamed officer opened his door.	article785331076.txt	386
While the details surrounding how Jean was killed are unclear, according to police, the officer admitted to killing him.	article785331076.txt	545
In a statement released on Friday, Dallas police said their officer called them after shooting Jean and told responding officers that “she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.”	article785331076.txt	666

On September 6, 2018 at about 9:59 p.m., an off duty Dallas Police officer called police dispatch and said she was involved in a shooting at the apartments located at 1210 S. Lamar.	article785331076.txt	1420
Preliminary information suggests that the officer arrived home in full uniform after working a full shift.	article785331076.txt	1602
The officer reported to the responding officers that she entered the victim’s apartment believing that it was her own.	article785331076.txt	1709
At some point, the officer fired her weapon striking the victim.	article785331076.txt	1828
Responding officers administered aid to the victim, a 26 year old male, at the scene.	article785331076.txt	1893
The victim was then transported to the hospital and pronounced deceased.	article785331076.txt	1979
Next of kin notification has not been made at this time.	article785331076.txt	2052
The officer was not injured and will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.	article785331076.txt	2109
The Dallas Police Department is conducting a joint investigation with the District Attorney’s Office.	article785331076.txt	2222
This investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so.	article785331076.txt	2324
If an average citizen walked into the wrong home and shot and killed an innocent homeowner, rest assured that they would be in jail right now.	article785331076.txt	2450
However, instead of immediately arresting the officer for trespassing and murder, she was simply placed on administrative leave a glaring function of blue privilege indeed.	article785331076.txt	2593
“Super scary because the police are supposed to protect you and then they come home and, you know, you’re just hanging out in your own house and then they come home thinking they’re home or whatever.	article785331076.txt	2766
I don’t know if she was tired but that’s pretty scary,” Richard Healy Nelson, who lives in the complex, said to reporters.	article785331076.txt	2966
NBC News spoke with Jean’s mother in a phone interview from her home in St. Lucia who was stunned to hear of his death.	article785331076.txt	3089
“He did no one any wrong,” she said.	article785331076.txt	3209
While the Free Thought Project consistently reports on police officers entering the wrong home during raids and killing, maiming, or traumatizing entirely innocent people, this is the first time we’ve reported a story of an off duty cop going into the wrong home, on their way home, and killing someone.	article785331076.txt	3246
The details of how or why this officer would walk into an apartment that was not hers are unclear.	article785331076.txt	3550
However, what is entirely clear is the fact that a mother and father are now and will be grieving for the rest of their lives because of her actions.	article785331076.txt	3649
And, in a slap to the face of Jean’s parents, the person who admitted to killing their innocent son has yet to be arrested.	article785331076.txt	3799

Dallas Chief Says She Can’t Fire Amber Guyger for Killing Botham Jean   Dept Rules Imply Otherwise	article788847916.txt	0
Dallas, TX   As citizens call for justice in the case of Dallas police officer Amber Guyger   the cop who killed the innocent Botham Jean in his own home   the controversy continues to grow.	article788847916.txt	100
In a town hall meeting this week, citizens showed that they still have a lot of questions for the Dallas Police Department in regards to the cold blooded killing of Botham Jean.	article788847916.txt	291
On top of questions as to why it took several days to arrest the cop   despite the fact that Guyger admitted to it   were questions like why this person who has proven to be a threat to society has yet to be fired from the police force.	article788847916.txt	469
During the meeting, as Chief Renee Hall dodged several questions over the details of the arrest, she did go out of her way to answer the question of why Guyger is still collecting a paycheck from their department.	article788847916.txt	706
The short of it, according to Hall, is she can’t fire her.	article788847916.txt	920

There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,” said Hall.	article788847916.txt	1635
But experts say this is not true.	article788847916.txt	1698
As WFAA reports, Justin Moore, a civil rights attorney was a panelist at the meeting and was surprised by the Chief’s comments.	article788847916.txt	1732
“I was completely mystified, and I really didn’t understand where it came from last night.	article788847916.txt	1860
It seemed like Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law,” said Moore.	article788847916.txt	1951
WFAA went further and noted that the “the Dallas Police Department general orders do allow the chief to take action, saying, ‘The Chief of Police may circumvent all formal disciplinary procedures to render an immediate decision when it deems it necessary to preserve the integrity of the department.’”	article788847916.txt	2036
Apparently, this “integrity” is not worth preserving and the Dallas police are going out of their way to keep a killer cop on their payroll.	article788847916.txt	2338
As WFAA pointed out, lots of cops across the state who have been under criminal investigation have been fired by police chiefs.	article788847916.txt	2479
This includes cops within the Dallas police department.	article788847916.txt	2607
Amy Wilburn, a former Dallas cop shot an unarmed teen in the stomach as he sat down with his hands in the air in 2013.	article788847916.txt	2663
Days later, after her account was found to be entirely false, she was fired for it.	article788847916.txt	2782
Wilburn became the first cop in 41 years   since officer Darrell Cain murdered a 12 year old boy in the back of his squad car   to be indicted for shooting a suspect.	article788847916.txt	2866
Also in 2013, officer Cardan Spencer shot a mentally ill man in his driveway.	article788847916.txt	3033
Days later, he was also fired after surveillance video proved he was lying about what happened.	article788847916.txt	3111
So why hasn’t the chief fired Gugyer, who has actually been charged, arrested, and admitted to killing an innocent man?	article788847916.txt	3207
Like all those accused of a crime, Amber Guyger deserves her day in court.	article788847916.txt	3327
However, as far as her job with the department is concerned, she has already proven that she is no longer fit for duty, ever again.	article788847916.txt	3402
WFAA asked the Dallas Police Department for the laws she cited claiming that she can’t fire Guyger, but they did not provide them.	article788847916.txt	3534
The department did respond about the general order mentioned by WFAA, however, saying, “General order 508 refers to the Police Chief’s ability to circumvent the formal disciplinary procedures not the investigative process.”	article788847916.txt	3665
Exactly what “investigative process” needs to happen before they can fire her remains unclear as this public servant admitted to killing an innocent man in his own home.	article788847916.txt	3889
At the very least, she should be fired for this.	article788847916.txt	4059
But then again, as we’ve reported already this week, Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules than common citizens, which apparently includes keeping a paycheck after admitting to killing an unarmed, innocent, pillar of society, Botham Jean.	article788847916.txt	4108

Couple question why police waited so long to search New Mexico compound	article777869943.txt	0
(CNN) A New Mexico couple told authorities months ago they thought a missing Georgia boy and his fugitive father were living in a filthy compound on their property.	article777869943.txt	73
But police did not carry out a search of the property until last week, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said, because they did not believe they had probable cause in the case.	article777869943.txt	238
That delay is facing scrutiny in the wake of Monday's discovery of a young boy's remains at the compound.	article777869943.txt	415
"They were dragging their feet.	article777869943.txt	521
They were taking too long," said Tanya Badger, who with her husband, Jason, told authorities about the boy's suspected presence at the compound.	article777869943.txt	553
"Even if they were trying to build a case or whatnot, a child's life is at stake."	article777869943.txt	698
It's not clear whether the remains are those of Abdul Ghani Wahhaj, a child with severe medical problems who disappeared from Georgia about nine months ago.	article777869943.txt	781
The remains were discovered in a wretched compound along with 11 starving children, authorities said.	article777869943.txt	938
More details about the horrid compound could be revealed Wednesday when the five adults arrested from the site make their first court appearances.	article777869943.txt	1040
Authorities raided the compound in Amalia, New Mexico, on Friday as part of their search for Abdul Ghani, whose father, Siraj Wahhaj, allegedly abducted him from Georgia in November.	article777869943.txt	1187
Neighbors raised alarm about a suspect	article777869943.txt	1370
The Badgers , whose land the compound was on, said they saw a boy they thought was Abdul Ghani in January and February.	article777869943.txt	1409
In April, they discovered the boy was listed as missing and his father a fugitive.	article777869943.txt	1529
They reported the sightings to state and local law enforcement, but it was months before police moved in, the couple said.	article777869943.txt	1612
"We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long," Tanya Badger said.	article777869943.txt	1735
New Mexico authorities had suspected the father and son might be at the compound after learning about the abduction in May, the sheriff said.	article777869943.txt	1810
But there was not enough evidence for a search warrant, and surveillance of the property didn't identify the pair there.	article777869943.txt	1952
"I had no probable cause to go onto this property," Hogrefe said.	article777869943.txt	2073
"In hindsight I wish there was, but we would not have been there lawfully."	article777869943.txt	2139
The sheriff said that "they did surveillance, both ground and aerial, and photographs were shared with the family and mother of the missing boy.	article777869943.txt	2215
The boy Abdul was never identified from those photos.	article777869943.txt	2360
Moving forward we knew that there was this compound, but we had very little details about it or who was occupying it.	article777869943.txt	2414
These people just kind of (sprang) up very quickly."	article777869943.txt	2532
The authorities' view changed Thursday when they said they received a message about possible starving children living on the compound, and had enough probable cause to put in an affidavit for a search warrant.	article777869943.txt	2585
"We are starving and need food and water," the message said, according to authorities.	article777869943.txt	2795
Authorities said it was forwarded to them but did not provide details on its origin.	article777869943.txt	2882
Compound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say	article777869943.txt	2967
When officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene.	article777869943.txt	3015
Stacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound.	article777869943.txt	3103
Obscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living.	article777869943.txt	3179
The children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said.	article777869943.txt	3265
"It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen," Hogrefe said.	article777869943.txt	3397
The father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults    Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille.	article777869943.txt	3475
All have been charged with abuse of the 11 children.	article777869943.txt	3670
Morten was charged with harboring a fugitive.	article777869943.txt	3723
However, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property.	article777869943.txt	3769
The couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid.	article777869943.txt	3857
Tanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul Ghani Wahhaj.	article777869943.txt	3995
They said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched.	article777869943.txt	4102

Abdul Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains.	article777869943.txt	4498
But hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children	article777869943.txt	4613
"My husband said he was taking Abdul Ghani to the park, and didn't come back.	article777869943.txt	4769
That was in November 2017.	article777869943.txt	4847
When I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night.	article777869943.txt	4874
But I haven't seen him since then," Ramzi said Tuesday.	article777869943.txt	4995
She said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention.	article777869943.txt	5051
An arrest warrant states that Wahhaj "wanted to perform an exorcism" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil.	article777869943.txt	5143
But Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya    an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness.	article777869943.txt	5276
"It's not an exorcism.	article777869943.txt	5423

He "just wanted to pray for Abdul Ghani to get better."	article777869943.txt	5502

In December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report.	article777869943.txt	5595

But at the time, the group told Alabama police they were headed to New Mexico for camping, and continued on their way.	article777869943.txt	5895
Even though the boy was reported missing, there was no child abduction warrant against Wahhaj because he was married to his son's mother, and they both had equal custody, Clayton County police said.	article777869943.txt	6014
The SUV was registered to Leveille, who was also in the vehicle.	article777869943.txt	6213

Federal judge rules against Trump administration on 3 D gun blueprint case	article782448403.txt	0

A federal judge on Monday issued a preliminary injunction continuing a prohibition on the Trump administration proposal to make available blueprints for so called ghost guns, untraceable weapons that can be manufactured on a 3D printer, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.	article782448403.txt	164
California was one of 20 states led by Washington that won the decision from U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik in Seattle.	article782448403.txt	450
The injunction extends a ruling last month that barred the Trump administration from taking steps that would allow the firm Defense Distributed to disseminate 3D gun blueprints.	article782448403.txt	576
“When the Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D printed, untraceable ghost guns, it needlessly endangered our children, our loved ones and our men and women in law enforcement,” Becerra said in a statement.	article782448403.txt	754
“The Trump Administration’s actions were dangerous and incompetent.”	article782448403.txt	1025
The action Monday keeps in place a July 31 court decision blocking the Trump administration pending a decision on the merits of a lawsuit by states opposed to the blueprints being published.	article782448403.txt	1094
“The Court finds that the irreparable burdens on the private defendants’ First Amendment rights are dwarfed by the irreparable harms the States are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, overall, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation,” Lasnik wrote in his decision.	article782448403.txt	1285

The radical leftist gun grabbing anti liberty California General Xavier Becerra is lying when he says the “Trump Administration inexplicably gave the green light to distribute on the internet blueprints of 3D printed, untraceable ghost guns.” The Department of Just(Us) settled a 1st Amendment claim filed by Cody Wilson, who created the code for 3 D guns.	article782448403.txt	1756
It was a case the government was about to lose.	article782448403.txt	2113

Robert Mueller Not Recommending Any More Indictments	article832917532.txt	0
Special counsel Robert Mueller will not recommend any more indictments as part of his investigation, the Justice Department announced Friday evening.	article832917532.txt	54
A senior Justice Department official announced the development shortly after the special counsel submitted its final report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.	article832917532.txt	204
Barr will now review the report and write his own report on Mueller’s findings and present them to Congress as soon as this weekend.	article832917532.txt	367
“I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to Republican and Democrat leaders on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.	article832917532.txt	500
He also said at no time did the Justice Department prevent Mueller from any actions he sought to make during the course of his investigation.	article832917532.txt	777
President Trump’s initial reaction to news of the report’s delivery is that he is “glad it’s over,” reported ABC News.	article832917532.txt	919
In a separate statement, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow said:“We’re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations.	article832917532.txt	1038
Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.”	article832917532.txt	1240
Following confirmation of the report’s delivery, several top Democrat lawmakers demanded its immediate public release.	article832917532.txt	1306
Sen. Mark Warner (D VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Mueller’s findings “must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.	article832917532.txt	1425
Nothing short of that will suffice.”	article832917532.txt	1659
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D CA) echoed Warner’s remarks, stating: “It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress.”	article832917532.txt	1696
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R IA), the former chair of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement “that we still haven’t seen any evidence of collusion.”	article832917532.txt	1942
“Republicans and Democrats have roundly praised Mueller’s reputation for integrity and thoroughness.	article832917532.txt	2100
Now that he’s wrapped up his investigation, Attorney General Barr must provide Congress and the American people with the findings to finally put an end to the speculation and innuendo that has loomed over this administration since its earliest days,” Grassley said.	article832917532.txt	2201

Judge Orders White House To Restore Jim Acosta' Press Pass   Trump Responds	article999001290.txt	0
A Trump appointed federal judge has order the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after the White House revoked it for his badgering of the White House press secretary, his handling of a White House aide and his continual questioning when he was allowed to ask a question and follow up.	article999001290.txt	77
The ruling has no basis in the Constitution, mind you.	article999001290.txt	388
USA Today reported on the ruling:	article999001290.txt	443
WASHINGTON – A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump.	article999001290.txt	477
U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, said the White House had violated Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process by suspending his press badge without explanation or a chance for CNN to appeal the decision.	article999001290.txt	711
Kelly said White House officials couldn’t say who made the decision or how.	article999001290.txt	945
The judge ordered the government to restore the credential while the rest of the case – which drew a slew of support from other media outlets, including USA TODAY – is argued.	article999001290.txt	1021
“This court cannot restore Mr. Acosta’s access to press briefings that have already been held,” Kelly said.	article999001290.txt	1197
But Kelly said he hasn’t considered at all yet whether the White House violated Acosta’s First Amendment rights.	article999001290.txt	1305
More arguments are expected Tuesday.	article999001290.txt	1418
“I trust this litigation will continue at a rapid pace.” Kelly said.	article999001290.txt	1455
What?	article999001290.txt	1524
Due process?	article999001290.txt	1530

Acosta's First Amendment rights weren't violated either.	article999001290.txt	2678
Furthermore, the White House did say they were willing to have another reporter in to the White House press from CNN, but that just wasn't good enough.	article999001290.txt	2735
CNN tweeted: "Statement from CNN and @ Acosta on today’s ruling: “We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days.	article999001290.txt	2887

He told Fox News' Chris Wallace, "Yeah, its fine, I mean it’s not a big deal.	article999001290.txt	3564

It’s not a big deal and if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference."	article999001290.txt	3793
In speaking about the rules and regulations the White House is writing up, Trump added, "We’re writing them now.	article999001290.txt	3891
We’ll have rules of decorum, you know you can’t keep asking questions.	article999001290.txt	4004
We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he’s supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and you know just shouting out questions and making statements, too."	article999001290.txt	4075
You know that isn't going to stop someone like Acosta, who claimed to deal in facts and truth, but clearly demonstrated he was all about lies when it came to putting his hands on a White House aide.	article999001290.txt	4360
The order by Judge Kelly is a temporary one that lasts for 14 days.	article999001290.txt	4559
“I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave," Trump continued.	article999001290.txt	4627
"I will say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I’ll leave.	article999001290.txt	4784
And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that’s acting up.”	article999001290.txt	4867
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement following the judge's ruling on Thursday.	article999001290.txt	4948
“Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.	article999001290.txt	5051
In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter’s hard pass.	article999001290.txt	5155
We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.	article999001290.txt	5237

On Saturday, there was an education panel at the Education Minnesota Apple Valley open to union members and guests.	article789512681.txt	2151
Prior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was "protected" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone .	article789512681.txt	2267
Loomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night.	article789512681.txt	2403
She stood alongside other female survivors of abuse.	article789512681.txt	2511
Ellison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene.	article789512681.txt	2564
At least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions.	article789512681.txt	2635
Failing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no "member's only" elevator to flee into.	article789512681.txt	2796
Finally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse.	article789512681.txt	3005
The irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood.	article789512681.txt	3101

This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, “I worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so.	article789512681.txt	3957
That’s it.” But that wasn’t it.	article789512681.txt	4067
Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison Muhammad, a self avowed member of the Nation of Islam.	article789512681.txt	4099
(Ellison Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)	article789512681.txt	4221
Fortunately for him, Ellison’s 5th District constituents haven’t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it.	article789512681.txt	4316
But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.	article789512681.txt	4507
Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison’s career: support for cop killers.	article789512681.txt	4689
In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis.	article789512681.txt	4777
Police later determined that Haaf’s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city’s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace.	article789512681.txt	4944
The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis’s house.	article789512681.txt	5310
Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.	article789512681.txt	5402
At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice.	article789512681.txt	5582
And within a month of Haaf’s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front.	article789512681.txt	5651
In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace.	article789512681.txt	5761
“The main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,” said Ellison.	article789512681.txt	5877
Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration.	article789512681.txt	6038
According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years.	article789512681.txt	6088
“If the police have some fear, I understand that fear,” Willis said.	article789512681.txt	6305
“We seem to have an overabundance of bad police.	article789512681.txt	6374
.	article789512681.txt	6423
.	article789512681.txt	6425
.	article789512681.txt	6427
[W]e’re going to get rid of them,” Willis said.	article789512681.txt	6429
“They’ve got to go.” The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison’s contribution to the demonstration: “Ellison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.	article789512681.txt	6477
That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.” Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.	article789512681.txt	6711
In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.	article789512681.txt	6830
Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf’s cold blooded murder: “We don’t get no justice, you don’t get no peace.” Ellison’s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years.	article789512681.txt	6910
The Haaf case wasn’t an aberration for Ellison.	article789512681.txt	7306
In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.	article789512681.txt	7354
(The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.	article789512681.txt	7741
Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.)	article789512681.txt	7853
In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu Jamal and “Assata Shakur” (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.	article789512681.txt	7894
Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.	article789512681.txt	8109
Bryan Burrough’s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard’s terrorist career.	article789512681.txt	8224
In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List.	article789512681.txt	8310
The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture.	article789512681.txt	8400
Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: “I am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they’re going to get Assata Shakur, they’re going to get a whole lot of other people,” he told the crowd.	article789512681.txt	8466
“I hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.” Ellison’s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.	article789512681.txt	8759
He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.	article789512681.txt	8935
Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (“Field Marshal Cinque”), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a “black gang member” and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution.	article789512681.txt	9033
He described her as one of those who had been “fighting for freedom in the ‘60s and’70s” and called for her release.	article789512681.txt	9265
Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento.	article789512681.txt	9382
According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight.	article789512681.txt	9538
The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.	article789512681.txt	9627
Seems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.	article789512681.txt	9724

“Federal Judge Denies New Mexico Compound Residents Bail,” by Vanessa Romo, KRWG, September 13, 2018:	article787730392.txt	1267
A federal judge denied bail on Wednesday to all five members of an extended family accused of operating a training camp for a violent attack on public institutions out of their isolated New Mexico compound.	article787730392.txt	1369
During the arraignment hearing, Magistrate Judge Kirtan Khalsa told the defendants there was “clear and convincing evidence that you are a danger to the community,” The Associated Press reported.	article787730392.txt	1576
A federal grand jury indicted the group on Tuesday on conspiracy and federal firearms charges stemming from the discovery of a cache of weapons after law enforcement raided their home in search of a missing boy but, instead, found 11 malnourished children living in squalid conditions.	article787730392.txt	1772
Federal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had “a common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.” U.S. Attorney John C. Anderson and Special Agent in Charge James C. Langenberg of the FBI’s Albuquerque Division, said in a statement that the defendants’ home in Amalia, N.M., served as a firing range and training camp to carry out an attack as part of a religious prophecy.	article787730392.txt	2058
According to the indictment, some of the minors were being prepared “to engage in jihad and … to die as martyrs.”… Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s lawyer in the state case, suggested that those charges were motivated by a degree of racial and religious prejudice against his Muslim client.	article787730392.txt	2573
If the suspects were white Christians shooting guns on their property and practicing their religion, “No one would bat an eye,” Thomas Clark argued in court.	article787730392.txt	2850
“If these were white people of a Christian faith who owned guns, that’s not a big deal because there’s a Second Amendment right to own firearms in this country.	article787730392.txt	3008
If these were white Christians, faith healing is of no consequence because we have freedom of religion in this country.	article787730392.txt	3169

From the beginning of this case, it was clear that Guyger was receiving special treatment from law enforcement.	article787966255.txt	1129
One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger’s “verbal commands.” Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this?	article787966255.txt	1241
Attorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that “The affidavit isn’t written objectively, not at the slightest.	article787966255.txt	1557
As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused.	article787966255.txt	1756
An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion.	article787966255.txt	1819
This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.”	article787966255.txt	1911
What’s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger’s apartment.	article787966255.txt	2017
For those who don’t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean’s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body.	article787966255.txt	2182
They attempted to assassinate Jean’s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment.	article787966255.txt	2330
However, they failed miserably at it.	article787966255.txt	2449
One thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn’t release any information on what they found in Guyger’s apartment.	article787966255.txt	2487
According to the information currently available, that’s because they didn’t search it.	article787966255.txt	2662
According to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case none of which were for the killer’s apartment.	article787966255.txt	2750
As WFAA reports:	article787966255.txt	2867
Two of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean’s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks.	article787966255.txt	2884
An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks.	article787966255.txt	3043
A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean’s apartment and collect additional evidence.	article787966255.txt	3157
A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted “laser measurements of firearm trajectory,” and collected “gunshot residue” from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean’s apartment.	article787966255.txt	3272
A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management’s office.	article787966255.txt	3515
A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting.	article787966255.txt	3661
An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for “linear access doors and gates,” an “elevator access door lock” report and a “lock audit report for both apartments.	article787966255.txt	3929
Now, even if police would try to search the killer cop’s apartment, it’s too late.	article787966255.txt	4151
On Sunday, apartment staff notified residents in an email that Guyger “has vacated her apartment and no longer resides at our community.”	article787966255.txt	4234
A manager at the complex declined to indicate exactly when Guyger moved out and if she left the premises voluntarily, the Dallas Morning News reports.	article787966255.txt	4372
While residents can certainly sleep better knowing that they don’t have to fear a killer cop walking into their apartment and murdering them, the family of Botham Jean likely sees this as one more instance of injustice.	article787966255.txt	4523
Mother of #BothamJean, Allison Jean, says the “smear” of her son is unacceptable.	article787966255.txt	4743

Kamala Harris calls for AG Barr to testify on Mueller probe, as 2020 Dems seize on report drop	article832913653.txt	0
The Democratic presidential contenders are uniformly calling for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian tampering in the 2016 presidential election to be released publicly – while at least one high profile candidate wants Attorney General Bill Barr to testify on the findings.	article832913653.txt	96
Minutes after the news broke Friday afternoon that the long awaited report had been submitted to Barr, the White House hopefuls quickly fired off statements calling for the Trump administration to ensure the documents go public.	article832913653.txt	385

“As Donald Trump said, ‘Let it come out.’ I call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Mueller's full report public as soon as possible.	article832913653.txt	789
No one, including the president, is above the law,” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote on Twitter.	article832913653.txt	940
Sen. Kamala Harris of California called for “total transparency” – then upped the ante by calling on Barr to testify.	article832913653.txt	1041
“The Department of Justice launched the Special Counsel investigation to get to the bottom of foreign interference in the 2016 election and any other illegal actions.	article832913653.txt	1159

Harris, Warren and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey have all started petitions to pressure the administration to release the report – though the White House has deferred to Barr on next steps.	article832913653.txt	1624
Booker also is using the report drop to raise money for his campaign.	article832913653.txt	1815

Star Tribune Sues To Unseal Accused Serial Woman Abuser Keith Ellison's Divorce Records	article790666929.txt	0
Flashback in 2004, when up until then, Barack Obama couldn’t win an election.	article790666929.txt	89

The Star Tribune has joined a legal effort to unseal the divorce records of U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the Democratic candidate for attorney general.	article790666929.txt	1357
Ellison and his ex wife, Kim Ellison, divorced in 2012.	article790666929.txt	1505
The related records have been sealed, so the public cannot access the information.	article790666929.txt	1561
The Star Tribune’s motion to intervene and unseal the records follows a similar action by Alpha News, a right leaning online news and opinion site.	article790666929.txt	1644
The efforts follow allegations by Ellison’s ex girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that Ellison domestically abused her in 2016.	article790666929.txt	1792
He has denied the allegation repeatedly, and Monahan has continued to press her case in frequent tweets about Ellison.	article790666929.txt	1912
On Sunday, Monahan tweeted to Ellison: “This is not going away and you are making it worse for you, your family and district by lying, smearing, getting others to do your dirty work, victim shaming, etc.” She referred again to a video she says she has of Ellison dragging her off a bed, which he has said did not happen.	article790666929.txt	2031
She has declined to show the video, saying it is traumatizing.	article790666929.txt	2352
She also told CNN she misplaced it.	article790666929.txt	2415
Monahan also recently released a medical record that shows she told a doctor in 2017 that she had been in an abusive relationship with Ellison.	article790666929.txt	2451
Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, said Tuesday that the party’s investigation of the allegations against Ellison will be finished soon, then released to the public.	article790666929.txt	2595
An external investigator was hired to conduct the inquiry.	article790666929.txt	2773
The Star Tribune argued that, given the public interest around that situation and Kim Ellison’s public support of her ex husband, the divorce records are a matter of concern to voters.	article790666929.txt	2832
Divorce records are typically public, but judges will often agree to seal them if both parties to the case agree and no one else objects.	article790666929.txt	3017
The Ellison campaign released a statement from Kim Ellison on behalf of both her and Keith Ellison.	article790666929.txt	3155
“Our divorce simply isn’t the public’s business, and therefore, when we separated, we jointly asked the court to seal the file.	article790666929.txt	3255
Now, one month before a closely contested election for Minnesota Attorney General, a conservative group wants to probe our divorce file in search of something to use against Keith in this race.	article790666929.txt	3383
I am disappointed that the Star Tribune would choose to file this motion.”	article790666929.txt	3577
Trump Vows to Kick CNN’s Acosta Out Again	article999001419.txt	0
President Trump took CNN’s improbable court victory temporarily restoring CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s “hard pass” media credential for the executive mansion in stride, vowing to kick Acosta out again in the future if he breaches White House protocol again.	article999001419.txt	43
The yanking of the physical credential, by the way, isn’t exactly a grave hardship.	article999001419.txt	315
It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non hard pass holding journalists who don’t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do.	article999001419.txt	399
Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House.	article999001419.txt	662
Speaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers.	article999001419.txt	741
"I think one of the things we’ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don’t have any air time, although I’ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows," Trump said.	article999001419.txt	918
"I mean, with this stuff you never know what’s going to happen."	article999001419.txt	1144
The president described Acosta as "unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who’s a wonderful woman," and said his administration is drawing up "rules and regulations" for White House reporters.	article999001419.txt	1209
"And if he misbehaves, we’ll throw him out or we’ll stop the news conference," Trump said.	article999001419.txt	1430
Acosta’s hard pass was pulled after a contentious Nov. 7 press conference at the White House.	article999001419.txt	1521
After interacting with President Trump – Acosta said he wanted to “challenge” him on calling the Central American caravans an “invasion” – the president called upon another reporter to speak.	article999001419.txt	1615
After lecturing Trump, Acosta belligerently refused to yield the microphone to a White House staffer and pushed her arm away as she reached for the device, all of which was captured on video.	article999001419.txt	1807
On Nov. 16, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta’s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit.	article999001419.txt	1999
But it was not a vindication of Acosta’s free speech rights under the First Amendment.	article999001419.txt	2224
The judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences.	article999001419.txt	2311
The temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.	article999001419.txt	2511
The White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences.	article999001419.txt	2741
The U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing.	article999001419.txt	2836
“The President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences.	article999001419.txt	2908
We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions."	article999001419.txt	3061
Acosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory.	article999001419.txt	3136
"I'm very grateful for what happened today," Acosta said.	article999001419.txt	3308
"I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this."	article999001419.txt	3366
"This was a test and I think we passed the test," he said.	article999001419.txt	3449
"Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution," Acosta said.	article999001419.txt	3508
"Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable."	article999001419.txt	3673
The court case isn’t over yet.	article999001419.txt	3888
The legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon.	article999001419.txt	3919
The court ordered the parties to “file a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]” according to its online docket.	article999001419.txt	3987
According to CNN, “White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.”	article999001419.txt	4172
From the looks of the letter, the W.H.	article999001419.txt	4322
is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month.	article999001419.txt	4361
CNN responded with this statement on Sunday: "The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution.	article999001419.txt	4481
These actions threaten all journalists and news organizations.	article999001419.txt	4618
Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President."	article999001419.txt	4681
The Acosta CNN lawsuit was filed by Ted Boutrous and Trump hating Republican lawyer Ted Olson, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher.	article999001419.txt	4775
Olson was solicitor general in President George W. Bush’s administration.	article999001419.txt	4914
(The legal complaint may be viewed here.)	article999001419.txt	4988
Boutrous said CNN is prepared to dig in for a protracted legal fight if it needs to.	article999001419.txt	5030
"We're ready to litigate as long as we have to, to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward," he said.	article999001419.txt	5115
Bill Clinton: ‘I Did The Right Thing’ During Lewinsky Affair; ‘I Do Not’ Owe Her Apology	article761568202.txt	0
Former president Bill Clinton has spoken out about what happened during his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.	article761568202.txt	90
Among other things, Clinton says Lewinsky is not owed an apology from him and he “did the right thing.”	article761568202.txt	221
As reported by CNN, Speaking to Today, Clinton defended his decision to remain in office following the scandal.	article761568202.txt	325
“A lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work, I think partly because they’re frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don’t seem to care,” Clinton said, pointing to a series of sexual misconduct allegations against current President Donald Trump, who has denied them.	article761568202.txt	437
“I think I did the right thing.	article761568202.txt	811
I defended the Constitution.”	article761568202.txt	843
In an essay for Vanity Fair published earlier this year, Lewinsky said she was questioning the narrative surrounding the affair, which played a central role in Clinton’s eventual impeachment.	article761568202.txt	873
“Now, at 44, I’m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,” she wrote.	article761568202.txt	1065
“I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.”	article761568202.txt	1237
When asked if he owed Lewinsky an apology, President Clinton told NBC‘s Craig Melvin, “No, I do not   I have never talked to her.	article761568202.txt	1354
But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.	article761568202.txt	1484
That’s very different.	article761568202.txt	1551
The apology was public.” Although some may not have taken what Clinton said as an apology, he did publicly acknowledge at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1998 that he had “sinned.”	article761568202.txt	1574
“I don’t think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned.	article761568202.txt	1756
It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I feel is genuine   first and most important, my family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family, and the American people.”	article761568202.txt	1819
Texan behind 3D printed guns vows legal fight as White House endorses court ruling | Bangkok Post: news	article776385494.txt	0
CHICAGO   A US gun rights advocate began gearing up for a legal fight Wednesday to be able to publish online blueprints for 3D printed firearms, as the White House signaled support for a federal judge's decision to block the venture.	article776385494.txt	105
Eight US states and the District of Columbia have argued in court that the blueprints available online to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons like this single shot "Liberator" handgun could fall into the wrong hands	article776385494.txt	339
Cody Wilson's Texas based company Defense Distributed had briefly made the blueprints available online, but Seattle based US District Judge Robert Lasnik granted an injunction Tuesday to take the material down.	article776385494.txt	566
The Donald Trump administration last month gave permission for Wilson to publish the blueprints, but the White House said Wednesday the president was unaware of the decision and was glad it was being reviewed.	article776385494.txt	777
Eight US states and the District of Columbia sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone    from a teen to a 'lone wolf' gunman    to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons.	article776385494.txt	987
Wilson complied with the judge's order, but put out a call for financial support for the legal battle ahead, including a scheduled August 10 court hearing.	article776385494.txt	1173
He told CBS News ahead of the injunction that he believes "access to firearms is a fundamental human dignity.	article776385494.txt	1329
It's a fundamental human right."	article776385494.txt	1439
"What I'm doing is legally protected," he said.	article776385494.txt	1472
"I will go to the appellate level.	article776385494.txt	1520
I will go to the Supreme Court.	article776385494.txt	1555
I will waste all my time."	article776385494.txt	1587
  President 'glad' for review	article776385494.txt	1614
As uproar was building Tuesday over Wilson's efforts, the president tweeted that making plastic 3D printed guns publicly available "doesn't seem to make much sense."	article776385494.txt	1644
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders elaborated Wednesday, saying the administration's Justice Department had acted on its own in granting Wilson permission to publish the blueprints on his Defcad website    settling a five year legal battle.	article776385494.txt	1810
"The Department of Justice made a deal without the president's approval," Sanders said.	article776385494.txt	2054
"The president's glad this effort was delayed to give more time to review the issue."	article776385494.txt	2142
Sanders also repeated the administration's claim from a day earlier that existing law already prohibits plastic firearms.	article776385494.txt	2228
The National Rifle Association, the nation's most politically influential gun rights group, echoed that claim, contending that the 1988 law made the current 3D printed gun issue moot.	article776385494.txt	2350
"Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years," the NRA said in a statement.	article776385494.txt	2534
But Wilson has gotten around the legal prohibition by providing instructions with the digital files for 3D printing his "Liberator" plastic gun that call for an approximately six ounce block of steel to be affixed to the weapon.	article776385494.txt	2691
Should those who print the gun follow those instructions, metal detectors would pick up the weapons, thus complying with the law.	article776385494.txt	2920
But while users can build the gun, there is no way to ensure they affix metal to it.	article776385494.txt	3050
  'The debate is over'	article776385494.txt	3135
Late Tuesday, dozens of Democratic senators introduced legislation to prohibit the publication of 3D printable firearm designs, a move gun control groups applauded.	article776385494.txt	3158
But some damage was already done.	article776385494.txt	3323
Wilson's blueprints had been posted on Defcad before the court order took effect and had already been downloaded thousands of times.	article776385494.txt	3357
"The debate is over.	article776385494.txt	3490
The guns are downloadable.	article776385494.txt	3511
The files are in the public domain    you cannot take them back," Wilson told CBS.	article776385494.txt	3538
Gun control groups nevertheless were relieved by the judge's decision, with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence calling 3D printed firearms "nothing short of a menace to society."	article776385494.txt	3621
"There is simply no way of telling how much damage has already been done by Cody Wilson's dangerous and reckless actions," Brady Campaign co president Kris Brown said in a statement.	article776385494.txt	3808
"This is a strong step and a clear victory for the entire gun safety movement, but we simply can't let up."	article776385494.txt	3991
Prior to last month, Wilson had actually been losing his drawn out legal battle, after both a federal district court and an appellate court ruled against him.	article776385494.txt	4099
The US Supreme Court declined to take up his case.	article776385494.txt	4258
But in a sign of his determination to continue the legal fight, a message on the Defense Distributed website made a public appeal for financial support "to uncensor the site."	article776385494.txt	4309
White House Restores CNN Acosta’s Pass But Imposes Strict Conduct Rules	article999000851.txt	0
Thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules.	article999000851.txt	73
CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta will get his “hard pass” restored, but thanks to his antics and confrontations with President Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all journalists seeking access to the presidential press room will now have to abide by written rules of conduct due to his misbehavior.	article999000851.txt	159
Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine sent a letter to Acosta on Monday, notifying him that his hard pass was restored, but that it could be suspended or revoked again if he fails to abide by the new rules that apply to all White House correspondents going forward.	article999000851.txt	495
Under the rules laid out in the letter, each journalist gets “a single question” before having to yield the floor, with follow ups solely at the discretion of White House officials.	article999000851.txt	787
Failure to obey the rules may result in suspension or revocation of the “hard pass,” the document allowing major networks regular access to the White House, RT reports.	article999000851.txt	969

“Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules,” wrote Sanders and Shine.	article999000851.txt	1909
Acosta’s pass was yanked following an incident at President Donald Trump’s November 7 press conference, where the CNN correspondent argued with Trump instead of asking questions (not for the first time) and physically prevented a White House intern from taking the microphone away from him.	article999000851.txt	2041
CNN responded by suing the White House, claiming that Acosta’s due process and free speech rights were being infringed.	article999000851.txt	2332
Last week, a federal judge ordered the pass temporarily restored on due process grounds.	article999000851.txt	2452
In response to the letter, CNN dropped the lawsuit.	article999000851.txt	2541
Mainstream media outlets that had joined CNN in suing Trump celebrated Monday’s letter, framing it as the White House “backing down” in face of the legal challenge while largely ignoring the implications of the new rules: that the media critical of Trump might have won a battle, but lost the war.	article999000851.txt	2593

“We have created these rules with a degree of regret,” Sanders and Shine wrote.	article999000851.txt	3033
“But, given the position taken by CNN, we now feel obligated to replace previously shared practices with explicit rules.”	article999000851.txt	3113
This means that Acosta, or any other reporter covering the White House, can get their pass suspended or revoked over specific conduct going forward, without having a leg to stand on in terms of due process.	article999000851.txt	3235
That leaves the First Amendment grounds, effectively arguing that access to the White House is a civil right under the US Constitution, for which there is no precedent under US law.	article999000851.txt	3442

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP)   Federal prosecutors say the FBI has arrested five former residents of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico on firearms and conspiracy charges as local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3 year old boy at the property.	article783774960.txt	1163
Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death.	article783774960.txt	1413
Gallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence.	article783774960.txt	1540
All five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court.	article783774960.txt	1615
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition.	article783774960.txt	1698
She is a Haitian national.	article783774960.txt	1867
The other four members are charged with conspiring with Leveille.	article783774960.txt	1894
And the death of the three year old?	article783774960.txt	1960
Nothing!	article783774960.txt	1997
And what of the training of little jihadis?	article783774960.txt	2006
Nothing!	article783774960.txt	2050
“The defendants, Jany Leveille, 35, a Haitian national illegally present in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, Hujrah Wahhaj, 37, Subhanah Wahhaj, 35, and Lucas Morton, 40, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico,” the bureau said in a statement.	article783774960.txt	2059
“The criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,” the bureau said.	article783774960.txt	2395
“The criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.”	article783774960.txt	2595
Yet, in the midst of all of this, don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases, which, if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life.	article783774960.txt	2772
In the meantime, the New Mexico district attorney who failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn’t show up for court is vowing to pursue prosecution of these jihadis.	article783774960.txt	2987
“The actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the individuals as charged originally,” Eighth Judicial District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement on Thursday.	article783774960.txt	3176
“While we disagree with the judges, they did their jobs.	article783774960.txt	3395
We will continue to do ours.	article783774960.txt	3452
“Going forward, our options are to refile the charges or take the cases to the grand jury.	article783774960.txt	3481
We are assessing and will decide which avenue to pursue.	article783774960.txt	3572
What is important to know is that we will continue to pursue prosecution of the cases.”	article783774960.txt	3629
StatementThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the... Posted by Eighth Judicial District Attorney on Thursday, August 30, 2018	article783774960.txt	3717
He also sought to fight back against criticism in his failure to perform his job.	article783774960.txt	3901
“Finally, I have always welcomed criticism and, as public servants, our judges should also,” Gallegos said in the statement.	article783774960.txt	3983
“However, I ask that you be civil and respectful in your criticisms as that is more constructive.	article783774960.txt	4108
Cussing and threatening the people involved will not accomplish justice and serves no useful purpose.	article783774960.txt	4206
Remember, you do not have all the facts.	article783774960.txt	4308
That will develop as the cases progress."	article783774960.txt	4349
Yeah, well, that's about as trustworthy as the FBI in this matter.	article783774960.txt	4391
This latest move, while welcome, may only be a response to President Donald Trump's vow to "get involved."	article783774960.txt	4458
However, I ask, why were you not involved in the first place, Mr. President?	article783774960.txt	4565
According to the Constitution, you, and you alone, are the sole head of the executive branch, and as such you are where the buck stop in making sure the laws are faithfully executed.	article783774960.txt	4642
So, if Trump is going to fire Sessions, perhaps he should stop talking about it and get to it and actually put someone in the Justice Department as attorney general who will do the job faithfully, and by that, I don't mean Trey Gowdy.	article783774960.txt	4825
I mean someone who is serious about justice, not political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity.	article783774960.txt	5060
Until then, I'll consider this the means the FBI will use to engage in the further coverup of what really took place at that compound beyond the bulldozing of a crime scene, and possibly, their own complicity.	article783774960.txt	5167

11 Children Have Been Rescued From a Muslim Extremist Run Compound In NM	article777720051.txt	0
Eleven children were rescued from a compound in New Mexico which was being run by armed Muslim extremists.	article777720051.txt	74
Authorities found all the children living in deplorable living conditions after raiding the property looking specifically for a three year old boy.	article777720051.txt	181
According to The Daily Caller, the police didn’t find the little boy, named Abdul Ghani Wahhaj, but they did discover 11 other children between the ages of one and 15 years old being held in the “saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,” Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement posted to the agency’s Facebook page Saturday.	article777720051.txt	329
Hogrefe also added that he only saw a few potatoes and a box of rice as food at the compound.	article777720051.txt	678
Abdul Ghani’s mother reported her son missing after Wahhaj took the boy, who turned 4 on Monday, to the park in Clayton County, Georgia, and didn’t return, The Albuquerque Journal reported.	article777720051.txt	772
She added the boy suffers from a medical condition.	article777720051.txt	962
Investigators believe that the three year old boy, who turned four on Monday, they were looking for had been at the compound in earlier weeks.	article777720051.txt	1014
Siraj Wahhaj, 39, and Lucas Morten, two very heavily armed men who are believed to be “extremist[s] of the Muslim belief,” were running the horrifying compound, Hogrefe said.	article777720051.txt	1157
When police arrived on the scene, Wahhaj was armed with an AR 15 style rifle and several loaded 30 round magazines.	article777720051.txt	1332
He also allegedly had on him four loaded pistols.	article777720051.txt	1448
According to a report by Fox News, Hogrefe said authorities had conducted surveillance of the compound while looking for the missing boy before he decided Thursday to get a search warrant.	article777720051.txt	1498
The warrant was immediately obtained after a Georgia investigator forwarded a message in which someone at the compound reportedly told another person that people who were living in the shanty were starving and needed water.	article777720051.txt	1687
“The message sent to a third party simply said in part, ‘We are starving and need food and water,’” Hogrefe said.	article777720051.txt	1911
“I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible.”	article777720051.txt	2025
Police stated on Sunday that they are still looking for Abdul Ghani.	article777720051.txt	2149
Reports: No New Indictments Will Come From Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Probe	article832917778.txt	0
No new indictments will come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe after he submitted his final report to Attorney General William Barr, multiple outlets are reporting.	article832917778.txt	83
A senior Justice Department official told The Washington Post that Mueller “has not recommended any further indictments.” “The investigation is complete,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told the newspaper.	article832917778.txt	265
The Mueller probe saw several within Trump's orbit indicted, but not Trump’s family or Trump himself.	article832917778.txt	483
Some notable figures who have pleaded guilty in charges stemming from Mueller’s investigation are Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.	article832917778.txt	585
Report: Jim Acosta and CNN File Lawsuit Against Trump Administration	article999000878.txt	0
CNN is taking the ongoing feud between President Trump and Jim Acosta to court.	article999000878.txt	70
Appearing on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” this Sunday, ABC’s former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson made the claim that Jim Acosta and CNN had already filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the White House’s decision to revoke the reporter’s press pass.	article999000878.txt	150
It appears that CNN is setting the wheels in motion for a lawsuit against the White House for removing the press credentials of Jim Acosta following a tense incident Wednesday during a news conference at the White House.	article999000878.txt	423
“I hope I’m not mistaken, but it’s my understanding that CNN and Acosta have sued, that there will be a court hearing on Tuesday on this very matter that we’ve been discussing,” Donaldson said.	article999000878.txt	644

Donaldson claims that he has already been asked to prepare an affidavit to be submitted to court, likely due to Donaldson’s own reputation for confrontation with the White House, including trading personal insults with President George Bush in 2006, RT reports.	article999000878.txt	1413
Donaldson also said that he had sent Acosta an email which encouraged him to ‘Keep it up”, and not to worry about the “vicious attacks” and “threats”.	article999000878.txt	1675
CNN released a statement saying no decision has been made as of yet on the lawsuit.	article999000878.txt	1826
The network has reached out to the White House on the issue but has “gotten no response”.	article999000878.txt	1910
Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” also featured constitutional lawyer Floyd Mayweather who emphasized that CNN would have a “really strong lawsuit” if they chose to proceed.	article999000878.txt	2000
Last Wednesday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders made the announcement that Acosta’s press pass had been suspended as a result of a tussle with a White House intern over a microphone following his sharp back and forth with Trump during the President’s post midterm Q&A.	article999000878.txt	2168
Acosta has disputed the accusation claiming he never put his hands on the young woman.	article999000878.txt	2446
Watching the full exchange it is obvious that President Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before rightfully losing his patients when Acosta refused to hand the mic over.	article999000878.txt	2533
Not only that, he used his hand to forcefully push the female interns arm away from the mic.	article999000878.txt	2803
Acosta should have been escorted from the room.	article999000878.txt	2896
He deserved to have his credentials revoked.	article999000878.txt	2944
Geert Wilders Puts the Political Elites On Notice	article763280007.txt	0
Geert Wilders spoke at a massive rally for Tommy Robinson on Saturday.	article763280007.txt	51
20,000 people came out to call for Tommy’s release, and Wilders took the opportunity to put the political elites of Britain and continental Europe on notice.	article763280007.txt	122
“Our governments,” Wilders declared, “sold us out with mass immigration.	article763280007.txt	280
With Islamization.	article763280007.txt	353
With open borders.	article763280007.txt	372
We are almost foreigners in our own lands.	article763280007.txt	391
And if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes.	article763280007.txt	434
But I say, no more!	article763280007.txt	502
And what do you say?	article763280007.txt	522
No more!	article763280007.txt	543
And that’s right: enough is enough.	article763280007.txt	552
We will not be gagged anymore.	article763280007.txt	588
No more tyranny.”	article763280007.txt	619
It was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all.	article763280007.txt	637
Several years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever – at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration.	article763280007.txt	728
Even worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern.	article763280007.txt	1228
Pamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad.	article763280007.txt	1333
Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.	article763280007.txt	1480
Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.	article763280007.txt	1594
The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.	article763280007.txt	1773
One – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest.	article763280007.txt	1946
Second – burn them to death.	article763280007.txt	2017
Third – throw ’em off a cliff.	article763280007.txt	2046
Fourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.	article763280007.txt	2077
Fifth – a combination of the above.”	article763280007.txt	2135
Theresa May’s relentlessly appeasement minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.	article763280007.txt	2172
One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.	article763280007.txt	2331
Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.	article763280007.txt	2389
But now matters are coming to a head.	article763280007.txt	2516
Apparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again.	article763280007.txt	2554
And so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny.	article763280007.txt	2664
Tommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs.	article763280007.txt	2782
Clearly the government’s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years long cover up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators.	article763280007.txt	2925
Theresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of “diversity” and “multiculturalism” will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence.	article763280007.txt	3129
The British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable.	article763280007.txt	3367
That heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now.	article763280007.txt	3521
British public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state.	article763280007.txt	3684
Wilders addressed this endeavor head on, declaring: “We will not be silenced.	article763280007.txt	3930
We will not be intimidated.	article763280007.txt	4008
And we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you.	article763280007.txt	4036
We will never surrender.	article763280007.txt	4091
We will stand strong and do our duty.	article763280007.txt	4116
We will defend our civilization.	article763280007.txt	4154
And we will protect our people.”	article763280007.txt	4187
Wilders added: “And I tell you, to the governments.	article763280007.txt	4220
You can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us.	article763280007.txt	4272
Because, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up.	article763280007.txt	4328
So take notice, Theresa May.	article763280007.txt	4408
Take notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte.	article763280007.txt	4437
Take notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron.	article763280007.txt	4478
Take notice: the future is ours and not yours.	article763280007.txt	4524
We will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.”	article763280007.txt	4571
If Wilders’ words don’t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand.	article763280007.txt	4647
